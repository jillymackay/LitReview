This study investigated whether the method of viewing lectures was related to student ratings of the course and its components and whether the method used changed over time. Methods: Preclinical medical students indicated whether ratings of course lectures were based primarily on lecture attendance, video capture, or both. Students were categorized into Lecture, Video, or Both groups based on their responses to this question. The data consisted of 7584 student evaluations collected over 2 years. Results: Students who attended live lectures rated the course and its components higher than students who only viewed the video or used both methods, although these differences were very small. Students increasingly watched lectures exclusively by video over time: in comparison with first- year students, second-year students were more likely to watch lectures exclusively by video; in comparison with students in the first half of the academic year, students in the second half of the academic year were more likely to watch lectures exclusively by video. Conclusions: With the increase in use of lecture video recordings across medical schools, attention must be paid to student attitudes regarding these methods.","[Burton, William B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Off Educ Resources, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Belfer 211F, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Ma, Terence P.; Grayson, Martha S.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Off Med Educ, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Belfer 211F, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Burton, WB (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Off Educ Resources, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Belfer 211F, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",william.burton@einstein.yu.edu,,,,,,22,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2382-1205,,,J MED EDUC CURRIC DE,J.

J,"Witton, G",,,,"Witton, Gemma",,,The value of capture: Taking an alternative approach to using lecture capture technologies for increased impact on student learning and engagement,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Lecture Capture technologies are becoming widespread in UK Higher Education with many institutions adopting a capture-all approach. Installations of capture devices in all teaching rooms and lecture theatres, scheduled recordings through integration with timetabling and automated distribution through virtual learning environments are swiftly becoming the norm. Capturing lectures has been shown to have a positive impact on student satisfaction, but numerous studies have shown little or no positive impact on student attainment as a result of capturing lectures. This article explores an alternative approach to the use of capture technologies in a pilot study at the University of Wolverhampton. The output of the pilot evaluation is a theoretical model recommending a shift in focus away from the conventional use of the technology for capturing lectures. It advocates a move toward the purposeful use of capture technologies to create content which adds value to student learning and increases engagement, which may ultimately lead to a positive impact on student attainment. The findings have implications for policy and practice around the use of capture technologies. Future work is described in the context of the project findings.","[Witton, Gemma] Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, England","Witton, G (reprint author), Univ Wolverhampton, Coll Learning & Teaching, City Campus,Wulfruna St, Wolverhampton WV1 1RH, W Midlands, England.",gemma.witton@wlv.ac.uk,,"Witton, Gemma/0000-0003-2488-0412",,,,12,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

Drawing on self-categorization theory, hypotheses were derived from a partial ingroup membership framework. In Study 1, an email from a Chinese student requesting a meeting about graduate training was sent to 419 White professors with the name of the sender being varied (Xian versus Alex). Use of the Chinese name led to fewer responses and agreements to meet than using the Anglo name. In Study 2, a lecture recording from an international graduate student was presented to 185 White undergraduates with the name of the lecturer varied (Jian versus John). The preference for Anglo (Chinese) names over Chinese (Anglo) names was apparent among those high (low) in assimilationist and low (high) in multicultural ideologies. These findings point to an important interplay between partial intergroup membership and acculturation ideologies of perceivers in predicting bias.

Objectives were to compare relative effectiveness of the four instructional methods with respect to knowledge about dietary sodium, ease of use of sodium reduction techniques, strategies to reduce sodium and attitudes about use of dietary sodium in cooking; and to compare student satisfaction with the instructional methods. A convenience sample of n = 139 students was randomized to receive the C, DP, OP, or OP+DP intervention. To measure effectiveness of each instructional method, a nutrition survey was administered as a pre-test, post-test, and an eight-week follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between DP, OP, and OP+DP groups on each subscale. However, each of these methods performed significantly better than the control group (C). DP, OP, and OP+DP methods were superior to the control group (C). In general, OP+DP resulted in the largest effect sizes, suggesting that this intervention was possibly more effective as compared to the OP or DP.

One widely-used method is the recording of lectures delivered during face-to-face teaching of on-campus courses. The recordings are subsequently made available to students on-line and have been variously referred to as lecture capture, video podcasts, and Lectopia. We examined the literature on lecture recordings for on-campus courses from the perspective of students, lecturers, and the institution. Literature was drawn from major international electronic databases of Elsevier ScienceDirect, PsycInfo, SAGE Journals, SpringerLink, ERIC and Google Scholar. Searches were conducted using key terms of lecture capture, podcasts, vodcasts, video podcasts, video streaming, screencast, webcasts, and online video. The reference sections of each article were also searched and a citation search was conducted. Institutions receive pressure from a range of sources to implement web-based technologies, including from students and financial imperatives, but the selection of appropriate technologies must reflect the vision the institution holds. Students are positive about the availability of lecture recordings. They make significant use of the recordings, and the recordings have some demonstrated benefits to student learning outcomes. Lecturers recognise the benefits of lecture recordings for students and themselves, but also perceive several potential disadvantages, such as its negative effect on attendance and engagement, and restricting the style and structure of lectures. It is concluded that the positives of lecture recordings outweigh the negatives and its continued use in higher education is recommended. However, further research is needed to evaluate lecture recordings in different contexts and to develop approaches that enhance its effectiveness.","[O'Callaghan, Frances V.; Neumann, David L.; Jones, Liz; Creed, Peter A.] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Sch Appl Psychol, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia","O'Callaghan, FV (reprint author), Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Sch Appl Psychol, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",f.ocallaghan@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,80,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1360-2357,1573-7608,,EDUC INF TECHNOL,Educ.

This paper is the first in a series of six publications that presents the local themes. It documents the interpretations of students' experiences with teachers, in reference to their use of four types of EOTs: online conference tools, learning management systems, blog sites and lecture capture tools.

This Point/Counterpoint article addresses the question of whether lecture recording should be mandatory in U.S. dental schools. Viewpoint 1 supports the statement that lecture recording should be mandatory. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that the benefits notably, student satisfaction and potential for improvement in student performance outweigh concerns. Viewpoint 2 takes the opposite position, arguing that lecture recording decreases students' classroom attendance and adversely affects the morale of educators.

There is a wealth of unfiltered educational resources for radiology on the internet. As a digital native, today's radiology trainee may have differing opinions from teachers about learning and intellectual property. To identify the preferences and philosophies regarding learning, technology and intellectual property toward the future development of an innovative radiology curriculum. An electronic survey with 22 questions was sent to 2,010 members of the Society for Pediatric Radiology and 100 radiology trainees. Three hundred sixty-one of the 2,110 surveys were returned. All questions were completed in 342 surveys. Fifty-three respondents were trainees (residents and fellows) and 289 respondents were radiologists (teachers). Time needed for a single learning activity in both groups is < 30 min, but teachers spend less time (P=0.007). The preferred learning environments were point-of-care and outside work hours for both groups. Ideal lecture durations were 31-45 min for trainees and 21-30 min for teachers (P=0.001). Adoption of new technology showed late majority and laggard trends for both groups (P=0.296). Interest in gadgets was greater in trainees (17%) than teachers (2%) (P < 0.001). Interest in lecture recording was greater in trainees (84%) than teachers (61%) (P=0.008). More trainees (61%) than teachers (42%) would not charge money for educational materials (P=0.028); 27% versus 13%, respectively, disagreed with dissemination of those materials beyond the institution (P=0.013). While millennial trainees are adult learners with a stronger comfort with technology, learning styles of trainees and teachers are more similar than was previously believed. Trainees and teachers hold conflicting philosophies about intellectual property. Results herein speak favorably for revising our teaching portfolio to include practical learning materials of short duration available at point-of-care.","[Bedoya, Maria A.; Back, Susan J.; Delgado, Jorge; Darge, Kassa; Reid, Janet R.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Radiol, 34th St & Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Back, Susan J.; Scanlon, Mary H.; Darge, Kassa; Reid, Janet R.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Scanlon, Mary H.] Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Radiol, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Reid, JR (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Radiol, 34th St & Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Reid, JR (reprint author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",reidj@email.chop.edu,,,,,,17,0,0,7,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0301-0449,1432-1998,,PEDIATR RADIOL,Pediatr.

The study assessed student satisfaction, extent of student engagement, overall course grades, and course director satisfaction. The students enrolled in a flipped classroom pediatric dentistry course (spring semester 2014; SP14) were asked to complete pre- and post course questionnaires to assess their perceptions of active learning, knowledge acquisition, and course satisfaction. The process was repeated with the class enrolled in the same course the following year (SP15). Responses for SP14 and SP15 resulted in an overall response rate of 95% on the pre questionnaire and 84% on the post questionnaire. The results showed that the greatest perceived advantage of the flipped classroom design was the availability and access to online content and course materials. Students reported enhanced learning due to heightened engagement in discussion. The results also showed that students' overall course grades improved and that the course director was satisfied with the experience, particularly after year two. Many calls have been made for educational strategies that encourage critical thinking instead of passive learning environments. This study provides one example of a course redesign and demonstrates the need for both faculty and student development to ensure success when a flipped classroom methodology is introduced.","[Bohaty, Brenda S.; Redford, Gloria J.] Univ Missouri Kansas City, Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, Kansas City, MO USA; [Bohaty, Brenda S.] Childrens Mercy Hosp, Kansas City, MO 64108 USA; [Gadbury-Amyot, Cynthia C.] Univ Missouri Kansas City, Sch Dent, Instruct Technol & Fac Dev, Kansas City, MO USA","Gadbury-Amyot, CC (reprint author), Univ Missouri Kansas City, Sch Dent, 650 E 25th St, Kansas City, MO 64108 USA.",amyotc@umkc.edu,,,,,,27,0,0,3,19,AMER DENTAL EDUCATION ASSOC-ADEA,WASHINGTON,"655 K STREET NW, SUITE 800, WASHINGTON, DC 20001 USA",0022-0337,1930-7837,,J DENT EDUC,J.

Students are demanding their lectures be recorded, but many instructors remain resistant. The goal of this study was to investigate faculty perceptions of lecture capture and to understand their concerns with the technology. Through a review of the existing literature, three common reasons for not recording were identified: impact on class attendance, incompatible pedagogy, and technical concerns. To test the hypotheses, an electronic survey was created and distributed to the faculty of a veterinary college in the southeastern US. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions. An invitation was emailed to all 134 faculty members, garnering 50 responses. Results were consistent with the hypotheses. Impact on class attendance, teaching styles, and technical considerations have dissuaded many instructors from adopting lecture capture technology. However, a fourth theme that emerged was faculty lack of awareness/familiarity. According to the qualitative responses, many faculty either did not know lecture recording was available in their teaching spaces or were not trained in how to use the technology. Recommendations for future research include distributing the survey campus-wide and providing more opportunities for faculty training. It would also be worthwhile to repeat the survey after providing more information and training materials to faculty, or after switching from an opt-in to an opt-out approach, to see whether perceptions have changed among the college's faculty.","[Kwiatkowski, Alison C.] George Washington Univ, 716 20th St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Demirbilek, Muhammet] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Instruct Technol & Comp Educ, Isparta, Turkey","Kwiatkowski, AC (reprint author), George Washington Univ, 716 20th St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",akwiatkowski@law.gwu.edu; mdbilek@sdu.edu.tr,,,,,,29,0,0,4,6,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0748-321X,1943-7218,,J VET MED EDUC,J.

In U.S. medical education, students encounter a large volume of content, which must be mastered at an accelerated pace. The added pressure to excel on the USMLE Step 1 licensing exam and competition for residency placements, require that students adopt an informed approach to the use of learning technologies so as to enhance rather than to detract from the learning process. The primary aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how students were using recorded lectures in their learning and how their study habits have been influenced by the technology. Methods: Survey research was undertaken using a convenience sample. Students were asked to voluntarily participate in an electronic survey comprised of 27 closed ended, multiple choice questions, and one open ended item. The survey was designed to explore students' perceptions of how recorded lectures affected their choices regarding class participation and impacted their learning and to gain an understanding of how recorded lectures facilitated a strategic, active learning process. Results: Findings revealed that recorded lectures had little influence on students' choices to participate, and that the perceived benefits of integrating recorded lectures into study practices were related to their facilitation of and impact on efficient, active, and self-directed learning. Conclusions: This study was a useful investigation into how the availability of lecture capture technology influenced medical students' study behaviors and how students were making valuable use of the technology as an active learning tool.","[Topale, Luminica] St Georges Univ, Sch Med, St Georges, Grenada","Topale, L (reprint author), St Georges Univ, Sch Med, St Georges, Grenada.",ntopale@sgu.edu,,"Topale, Nitsa/0000-0001-9432-947X",,,,31,1,1,1,17,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1472-6920,,,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

The literature has, so far, relied on surveying students to discover their use of the technology or attempted to quantify the impact of watching lecture recordings on assessment performance. Alternatively, the principal contribution of this article is an evaluation of the use of the recorded lectures using a revealed preference approach. Specifically, we identify to what extent students watched lecture recordings, rather than simply claimed to watch them, when asked to provide comments on the technology. Data indicate the number of distinct students who watched recordings, the frequency with which they watched recordings, the average length of viewings as well as the time of the day when lectures were viewed. We monitored viewings over two academic years, identifying spikes' in the number of viewings in the days before tests, as well as regularities in the viewing patterns across the 2years. We analyse the data to assess the extent to which students used the recordings, how and when they watched the recordings. We conclude that the students value lecture recordings, making more extensive use of the recordings than has been identified in the literature, to date. Ultimately, lecture recordings are suggested to offer valuable support for students' independent study.","[Elliott, Caroline] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Neal, David] Univ Lancaster, Informat Syst Serv, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England","Elliott, C (reprint author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",c.f.elliott@hud.ac.uk; d.neal@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,29,1,1,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1469-7874,1741-2625,,ACT LEARN HIGH EDUC,Act.

In prior studies it has been reported that students prefer weblectures with a visible lecturer over weblectures consisting of audio and slides only. Anticipated was that the amount of attention students pay to a weblecture is relevant for this preference. A study was conducted to see whether lecturer-visibility was related to reported attention for a weblecture. Lecturer's appeal was expected to be a moderator in this relation. Eighty-eight participants viewed two different clips of weblectures in one of three visibility-modes where the lecturer was visible in a large or a small frame, and where the slides were large or small. After watching the lecture their opinion was asked about their attention and, after the second lecture, to compare their attention to the first lecture. The two weblectures were analysed separately. Weblectures of six different lecturers were used, integrated in a web application so participants could participate from home. Nine other variables, that could influence attention, were used as control variables in analysis. For the first weblecture no differences on reported attention were found between the visibility-modes. For the second weblecture participants reported significantly more attention for the condition in which a large image of the lecturer was shown than for the condition in which a small image of the lecturer was shown. Lecturer's appeal was found not to moderate the relation between the visibility of the lecturer and reported attention. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, conducted in 2 sections of a large active-learning undergraduate introductory biology class with daily podcasts, average attendance remained high (89.5 %). More than 50 % of the students used podcasts but less than 3 % of the variance in actual minus predicted exam performance was correlated with the number of podcasts viewed. Podcast use also varied significantly with gender and ethnicity but even within high use subgroups (females and Asians) less than 6 % of the variance in exam performance was correlated with the number of podcasts viewed.

The aim of this paper is to present a reflection and a previous study to identify the possibility to apply the model in some subjects of some disciplines. The study is carried out by a group of teachers from some schools of the Polytechnic of Porto. New generations are increasingly familiar with learning technologies and after the generalization of distance education in schools students have begun to develop learning mechanisms adapted to their own needs, searching resources that allow them to acquire more and faster knowledge through for example in video classes, focused on the subject they are learning on a given time. Learning environments are based on micro perspectives (micro learning) inserted in the context of learning and intended to deal mainly with relatively small learning units and short-term learning activities. For example Youtube (with their video lessons), has proven to be a strategic partner of millions of learners around the world seeking specific training in such diverse areas such as programming or health. Can we correlate the micro learning emerging activities like Flipped Classroom strategy (type of blended learning that inverts the traditional educational model, offering educational content on the web, outside the classroom) where the lecture recording systems play a key role in providing activities type ""homework"" in the classroom? The methodology to be applied is based on a model of micro activities inserted in some subjects by teachers related to this study. They have identified some micro learning activities where students are encouraged to acquire knowledge previously and apply them in the classroom. Have being tested the working capacity of some students (in the handling some software tools) with the purpose to compare students performances that previously viewed related educational resources. If the learning process can be reversed, students can attend lectures and other educational content quietly on the couch and conduct their home studies to be more involved in the discipline under the guidance of a tutor. Our homes begin to have installed Smart TVs, which have an operating system very similar to smartphones that can run apps and other services and access to the internet. It becomes possible to access video lessons on the TV focused on micro issues that combined with the comfort of the couch can be translated into a learning model based on the Flipped Classroom style where the leisure content and recreation can give way to a quiet and comfortable learning. The mirroring techniques where the TV and Smartphone must be on the same network, came to join the Miracast wireless technology that can be used by PCs or smartphones to duplicate device screen on TV. The combination of the presented technologies and methodologies may represent an interesting change from the perspective providing a more commodious learning and focused only on desired topics. Apparently ""learning on the couch"" can contribute to a more distributed education system. Conclusions related with this reflection will be presented to other teachers who may want to apply the model in their disciplines. For each of these test subjects integrating content will be identified in theoretical and practical activities.","[Vieira de Castro, A.] Politecn Porto ISEP, Oporto, Portugal; [Oliveira, L.] Politecn Porto ESEIG, Oporto, Portugal; [Peres, P.] Politecn Porto ISCAP, Oporto, Portugal","de Castro, AV (reprint author), Politecn Porto ISEP, Oporto, Portugal.",,,"Peres, Paula/0000-0003-4964-5929",,,,17,0,0,0,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-608-8860-4,EDULEARN PROC,,,2016,,,,,,,2846,2855,,,,10,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BH7TE,WOS:000402955902133,,No,,,29/11/2017

As an IT educator, we always come across a high degree of digital divide among students, as exemplified by the post-course student evaluation feedback: a group of students reflected the foundation IT course as ""too easy"" but another group expressed as ""too difficult"". Educational technology solutions, e.g., lecture capturing, have been adopted to archive the classroom delivery for subsequent review by students so that users can access the relevant contents on demand anytime and anywhere with a mobile device connected to the Internet. Educators advocate that the use of lecture capturing generally improves students' academic performance. This paper extends the discussion with another angle: how does lecture capturing improve learning? Specifically, our research questions are: 1) Do students' frequency of access and duration of watching the captured lecture directly influence the academic results? and 2) Is lecture capturing effective for all students, or only to some student groups with different academic performance? A data driven approach was used to analyze the relationship between students' academic performance, the frequency and duration of accessing the captured lecture contents. Our results suggest that lecture capturing is more effective among the mid-range achievers, and tend to have minimal effects on the two ends of the achiever scale (i.e., two extremes: the high achievers and the low achievers).","[Mark, Kai Pan] BNU HKBU United Int Coll, Comp Sci & Technol Programme, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mark, Kai Pan] BNU HKBU United Int Coll, Informat Technol Serv Ctr, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Vrijmoed, Lilian L.

As research begins to accumulate on the effectiveness of Lecture Capture (LC) in HEIs, it appears that LC is largely beneficial to students' learning and their academic performance. It is less clear, however, how the use of LC has impacted on lecturers' own teaching practice, as studies that explore this issue have only begun to surface fairly recently. Has the use of LC impacted on lecturers' design and delivery of learning activities and programme of study? Has it influenced their ways of giving student feedback and support? Does it have any impact on their knowledge and professional values? Understanding how staff use these systems to develop their own practice is an issue that has largely been unexplored but it is important to enhance reflexive teaching. This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of LC on staff's teaching practice, through a web survey of academics (n46) in an English University. The descriptive statistics revealed the use of LC impacting four areas of teaching activity (delivery of lectures and supporting learning; assessment and feedback related activities; developing effective learning environment and their approach to student support and guidance; engaging in their continuous professional development and their approach to incorporation of research and evaluation of their practice) as well as their core knowledge and commitment to professional values. Relatively less impact on the area of designing and planning learning sessions was reported. It is concluded that there is strong evidence to indicate that the LC has impacted academics' core knowledge, their commitment to professional values and certain teaching practices. The findings have important practical implications, as they provide HEIs with a new set of evidence to build a convincing case for implementation, promotion, and sustained use of LC as tool to enhance teaching practice.","[Joseph-Richard, Paul; Price, Daran; Okafor, Godwin; Almpanis, Timos] Southampton Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England","Joseph-Richard, P (reprint author), Southampton Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England.",Paul.joseph-richard@solent.ac.uk; Daran.price@solent.ac.uk; Godwin.okafor@solent.ac.uk; Timos.almpanis@solent.ac.uk,,,"Solent Teaching and Learning Institute, Southampton Solent Univeristy","This research was supported by Solent Teaching and Learning Institute, Southampton Solent Univeristy.",,29,0,0,1,1,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2048-8637,,978-1-911218-17-3,PROC EUR CONF ELEARN,,,2016,,,,,,,331,339,,,,9,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BH4FL,WOS:000400303700043,,No,,,29/11/2017

Methods: The investigators conducted a survey among third-year preclinical medical students in a large medical school in Thailand. The questionnaire contained three parts: (1) demographic data, (2) students' use of LRS and (3) study behaviours of students-using a modified version of the Study Behaviours Inventory (SBI-HS), to compare subjects with and without an LRS. Results: We received 101 completed questionnaires (33% response rate). Ninety-five percent of survey respondents used the LRS, with 51% using the LRS less than 2 hours per day and 49% more than 2 hours per day. When combining scores from all items, there was no significant difference in students' overall study behaviours between subjects with and without an LRS, t(85) = -0.77, p = 0.44. However, nine individual items showed significant differences between subjects, with eight of nine showing better study behaviours for subjects with an LRS than those without an LRS.

Using a mixed method design with both quantitative and qualitative methods to collect data, instruments included a student questionnaire, interviews and focus groups, lecture capture usage statistics, and grades. Results showed that 63% of students were satisfied with lecture capture and 75% of students indicated that it had facilitated their learning. Students primarily used the recordings to learn what they had missed while in class (79%) or because they were absent (72%). 70% of students reported having watched at least 50% of the recorded material (27% watched all the material), and only 8% of students did not view any recordings. Student satisfaction had a significant positive relationship with the number of lectures viewed. In regards to attendance, the self-reported data from students indicated that 61% of students did not miss classes (none or just one class). Students with the greatest number of missed classes viewed the recordings more frequently. As for student achievement, 68% of students indicated that lecture capture helped them to achieve better grades. Students with lower course marks accessed the recordings more frequently than those with higher marks. Instructor perceptions were that lecture capture predominately helped average to below average students achieve slightly better marks, but had less of an impact on the grades for particularly low and high achieving students.","[Groen, Jovan F.; Quigley, Brenna; Herry, Yves] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Groen, JF (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",jgroen@uottawa.ca; bquig021@uottawa.ca; yherry@uottawa.ca,,,,,,34,0,0,2,2,SOC TEACHING & LEARNING HIGHER EDUCATION,HAMILTON,"MILLS MEMORIAL LIBRARY L211, MCMASTER UNIV, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L6, CANADA",1918-2902,,,CAN J SCHOLARSH TEA,Can.

A small survey provides an indication that students may not necessarily be making the best use of their technologies or have access to alternative ways of viewing online learning materials. Where there are options to view videos using lecture capture systems; time constraints and the quality of the videos prove to be further barriers, rather than providing a successful outcome.

Surprisingly, in the last week of semester, 29% of students reported not yet accessing lecture recordings. Students had the intention to use lecture recordings as they envisaged these to be helpful for learning and commented that they would be adversely affected if recordings were not available. In fact, students are passionate about lecture recordings.

Students could select either course format, both with the same instructor and course requirements, without capacity restrictions. We find that students' attitudes toward online learning are the chief determinant of their choice of class over demographics, opportunity cost measures, or past online experiences. Additionally, our findings suggest that lecture capture students perform as well as those who take a face-to-face course when not accounting for self-selection.

Providing excellent teaching and learning to these large classes is an ongoing challenge for teaching faculty, a challenge intensified when the cohort comprises 85% non-native English speakers. This paper presents the findings of a project to supplement face-to-face lectures on a large campus-based taught MSc programme with a set of rich-media materials. These resources consisted of audio podcasts, audio-narrated slides, short video segments and full-video lecture capture. The aim of the study was to examine student usage of, and preference for, these different rich-media materials. Key findings are that students valued most highly the full-video lecture capture followed by the audio-narrated slides, using the materials primarily to consolidate their understanding and as revision aids. Students also emphasised the central importance of the face-to-face lecture - viewing the rich-media materials as complementary to, rather than as a replacement for the traditional lecture. Nor did the majority of students see the provision of videoed lectures as a reason for non-attendance at lectures. The findings of this study provide confirmatory evidence of the ongoing importance of the traditional lecture in large cohort HE teaching together with an acknowledgement of the benefits that rich-media materials can bring to the student learning experience.","[Saunders, F.

Although this technology has long been considered too expensive for large-scale use, it is quickly becoming ubiquitous and deployable using ordinary computers and consumer-grade software. Using survey and final-grade data from a three-semester trial in a large introductory-level political science course, the authors demonstrate students almost universally approve of the technology and support its use in future classes. Students are most likely to use recordings when they study for exams and catch up on material after being absent from class. Additionally, certain subgroups-primarily international students and those who are performing poorly in the class-are more likely to watch archived recordings. However, these data demonstrate that positive evaluations and increased usage may not translate into better grades; viewing lectures does not appear to substantially improve individual performance.","[Mallinson, Daniel J.] Stockton Univ, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA; [Baumann, Zachary D.] Penn State Univ, Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Mallinson, DJ (reprint author), Stockton Univ, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA.",Daniel.Mallinson@stockton.edu; zdb1@psu.edu,,"Mallinson, Daniel/0000-0002-8094-6685",,,,10,1,1,1,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1049-0965,1537-5935,,PS-POLIT SCI POLIT,PS-Polit.

Gamification is the notion that gaming mechanics can be applied to routine activities. In this study, TurningPoint (TP) ARS interactions were gamified and implemented in 22 large group medical microbiology lectures throughout an integrated year 1 osteopathic medical school curriculum. Methods: A 32-item questionnaire was used to measure students' perceptions of the gamified TP interactions at the end of their first year. The survey instrument generated both Likert scale and open-ended response data that addressed game design and variety, engagement and learning features, use of TP questions after class, and any value of lecture capture technology for reviewing these interactive presentations. The Chi Square Test was used to analyze grouped responses to Likert scale questions. Responses to open-ended prompts were categorized using open-coding. Results: Ninety-one students out of 106 (86 %) responded to the survey. A significant majority of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the games were engaging, and an effective learning tool. The questionnaire investigated the degree to which specific features of these interactions were engaging (nine items) and promoted learning (seven items). The most highly ranked engagement aspects were peer competition and focus on the activity (tied for highest ranking), and the most highly ranked learning aspect was applying theoretical knowledge to clinical scenarios. Another notable item was the variety of interactions, which ranked in the top three in both the engagement and learning categories. Open-ended comments shed light on how students use TP questions for exam preparation, and revealed engaging and non-engaging attributes of these interactive sessions for students who review them via lecture capture. Conclusions: Students clearly valued the engagement and learning aspects of gamified TP interactions. The overwhelming majority of students surveyed in this study were engaged by the variety of TP games, and gained an interest in microbiology. The methods described in this study may be useful for other educators wishing to expand the utility of ARS in their classrooms.","[Pettit, Robin K.; McCoy, Lise; Kinney, Marjorie; Schwartz, Frederic N.] AT Still Univ, Sch Osteopath Med Arizona, Mesa, AZ 85206 USA","Pettit, RK (reprint author), AT Still Univ, Sch Osteopath Med Arizona, 5850 E Still Circle, Mesa, AZ 85206 USA.",rpettit@atsu.edu,,,HRSA [D54HP20674],This research was supported by HRSA grant no.D54HP20674.,,55,5,5,4,55,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1472-6920,,,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

This paper aggregates and critically reviews the associated literature, thematically organised in response to four questions. In response to the first question - does student attendance decrease when online content is made available research indicates that students primarily use digital content for review and revision rather than as a substitute for on-campus attendance. Analysis of the research in response to the second question - is achievement affected when attendance is face-to-face versus online - revealed no empirically supported significant difference. The third question was whether online content is better suited to some pedagogical tasks than others. A predominant theme in the literature is that digital content has potential as a disruptive pedagogy, accelerating an overall shift from didactic lecture to constructivist learning. Analysis revealed a research gap around the fourth question - is there evidence that some online formats are particularly suited to advancing learning. The few published comparative studies revealed contradictory results. Overall conclusions from the combined questions are that online digital content is a worthwhile learning and teaching pursuit and discipline and context must be considered in designing the particular approach.","[Kinash, Shelley] Bond Univ, Off Learning & Teaching, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia; Australian Govt, Dept Social Serv, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia","Kinash, S (reprint author), Bond Univ, Off Learning & Teaching, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia.",skinash@bond.edu.au; dknight@bond.edu.au; matthew.mclean@live.com.au,,,,,,58,2,2,3,25,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, LEARNING  TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE",PALMERSTON NORTH,"BAG 11-222, MASSEY UNIVERSITY, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND",1436-4522,,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

The findings derived from students' reported data suggest that students are well aware of a number of limitations of live lectures as a teaching method, yet despite that awareness, it rarely affects their decision to attend live lectures or not.

To eliminate the overhead of expensive camera-work professionals, recently, image recognition algorithms combined with camera controllers make automatic lecture recording possible. In this article, we present real time implementation of the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) based automatic lecture recording system. The system comprises of FPGA board, which can take input from analog and/or digital video camera, the ARM processor unit, and camera mounted stepper motor. Real time Image recognition algorithms are used to detect the region of interest (ROI) boundaries, instructor's face, and instructor's movement direction. The stepper motor rotates the mounted camera as directed by the FPGA controller to follow the lecturer and board. Further, the proposed system is designed in a compatible manner that can take input from a variety of video formats.

Therefore, this study explores how three commonly used video lectures styles affect the sustained attention, emotion, cognitive load, and learning performance of verbalizers and visualizers in an autonomous online learning scenario by using a two-factor experimental design, brainwave detection, emotion-sensing equipment, cognitive load scale, and learning performance test sheet. Analysis results indicate that, while the three video lecture types enhance learning performance, learning performance with lecture capture and picture-in-picture types is superior to that associated with the voice-over type. Verbalizers and visualizers achieve the same learning performance with the three video types. Additionally, sustained attention induced by the voice-over type is markedly higher than that with the picture-in-picture type. Sustained attention of verbalizers is also significantly higher than that of visualizers when learning with the three video lectures. Moreover, the positive and negative emotions induced by the three video lectures do not appear to significantly differ from each other. Also, cognitive load related to the voice-over type is significantly higher than that with by the lecture capture and picture-in-picture types. Furthermore, the cognitive load for visualizers markedly exceeds that of verbalizers who are presented with the voice-over type. Results of this study significantly contribute to efforts to design of video lectures and also provide a valuable reference when selecting video lecture types for online learning.","[Wang, Wen-Fang; Chen, Chih-Ming; Wu, Chung-Hsin] Natl Chengchi Univ, Grad Inst Lib Informat & Archival Studies, Taipei, Taiwan","Wang, WF (reprint author), Natl Chengchi Univ, Grad Inst Lib Informat & Archival Studies, Taipei, Taiwan.",103155001@nccu.edu.tw; chencm@nccu.edu.tw; 100155002@nccu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Chih-Ming/0000-0002-7088-5516",,,,13,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4799-9958-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,385,390,,10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2015.225,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Computer Science,BF3EK,WOS:000380532300072,,No,,,29/11/2017

Lectures are by far the most prevalent method of education and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. Worldwide about 100,000,000 lecture hours are given live annually and almost none recorded - even though student seek out recorded lectures. Existing lecture capture technology is a partial solution - but those systems are expensive, complex, and managing them (and the recorded lectures) requires an IT department. This results in only very few of the 100,000,000 lecture hours given annually by colleges around the world being recorded - an enormous waste of valuable content LectureMonkey is a student and teacher collaborative solution, which leverages students mobiles to record any lecture anywhere, turn any classroom into a collaborative, active classroom and any lecture into a blended learning experience. LectureMonkey has been doing research in the marketplace over the last two years - letting students and teachers use the system to record and share lectures. We have used iterative and agile methodologies to quickly modify the product based on feedback. During these iterations we have learned what works and what doesn't, and what it will take to spark mass lecture capturing. LectureMonkey has been downloaded about 60,000 times, and has been used to record around 2,800 lectures (about 180 a month). Lectures have been viewed 14,000 times by 3,400 users. Just imagine how learning would change if everyone knew that at the end of class they would have a recording available - not just audio, but rich media that includes audio, boards and presentation. Add student comments as a natural part of the flow of the recording, mix in sharing among classmates and you have a recipe to radically improve the way students learn. LectureMonkey provides the ability to automatically capture every lecture using smartphones, making those recordings a part of the class notes - which can be easily shared with and enhanced by classmates. Needing only a smartphone and access to the Internet, LectureMonkey combines lecture capture (high quality audio, board images and presentation capture) and collaborative comments into a crowd sourced, shared, multimedia summary of a class. Students can have all their lectures and notes in their pocket or in a browser - available anytime, anywhere. LectureMonkey is the only solution for mass ad-hoc lecture capture for live lectures anywhere, anytime - even though lecture capturing has a proven benefit for students. LectureMonkey modernizes class notes. Class notes are crucial to learning, but haven't really changed since the 1950's. LectureMonkey combines lecture recording together with the mobile paradigms of texting, tweeting, snapchat for collaborative note taking to enhance learning. LectureMonkey democratizes modern pedagogical strategies like flipped classrooms and peer learning by making it simple for every live lecture to easily become an active, e-Learning experience that embraces paradigms natural to today's students","[Ukelson, Jacob P.] LectureMonkey, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Ukelson, JP (reprint author), LectureMonkey, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4673-8243-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,401,405,,,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Engineering; Telecommunications,BF4AT,WOS:000380612800086,,No,,,29/11/2017

Examples include the use of 'flipped classroom' approaches where students can access video in advance of interactive classroom sessions; student-generated videos where students themselves create videos explaining key scientific concepts; and lecture capture sessions where cameras are integrated into learning spaces so that traditional lectures can be recorded and replayed on demand. This list is by no means exhaustive as video creation and platform technologies continue to evolve. Research so far indicates that presenting instructions and explanations directly to camera is the most common video production style being used in universities. This frequently involves head-and-shoulder style videos featuring academics speaking to the camera about the chosen topic and possibly demonstrating aspects of a technique or approach that they wish to explain. In some cases, video production teams with specialised expertise are employed to record and produce such video resources. However, there are problems associated with adopting this approach in a laboratory context. Firstly, there are obvious cost issues involved with engaging specialised expertise for this type of work, putting it beyond the reach of many university budgets. Secondly, there are physical limitations with the space available in laboratories - tripods and other video equipment take up valuable space in a busy lab, and there are possibly health and safety risks to consider. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, there is no independent evidence that a video format where we see the lecturer completing a series of steps is the best way to teach an experiment through the medium of video. At the Biomedical Diagnostics Institute at DCU, Ireland, a pilot project was run to create wearable camera-recorded video in a laboratory setting and evaluate its potential effectiveness as a learning tool. Two videos were created by an academic using a head-mounted wearable camera. One of these was developed to demonstrate and record the steps involved in performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). This video was subsequently edited down to approximately 10 minutes in length and was shared with separate cohorts of undergraduate and postgraduate students. Students were asked to provide feedback on their experience of the video via a Moodle-based questionnaire. This case study sets out to explore students' reaction to the wearable camera-created video and in particular, their comments on the Point of View (POV) angle employed. This is a topic that has not received significant attention in the literature to date.","[Devine, Tatyana; Gormley, Clare; Doyle, Patrick] Dublin City Univ, Dublin 9, Ireland","Devine, T (reprint author), Dublin City Univ, Dublin 9, Ireland.",tatyana.devine@dcu.ie; clare.gormley@dcu.ie; patrick.doyle@dcu.ie,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2048-8637,,978-1-910810-71-2,PROC EUR CONF ELEARN,,,2015,,,,,,,181,189,,,,9,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BE4NM,WOS:000371972900024,,No,,,29/11/2017

This study measured the relationship between perceived difficulty and the use of lecture capture technology in a second year biochemistry course while additionally taking into account student learning approaches, comfort with technology, gender and performance outcomes. In several analyses, it was found that a higher perceived level of difficulty was associated with an increased number of video accessions, although this relationship was not consistent across all topics. As well, it was found that surface learning approach score and gender were significantly associated with the number of accessions of lecture capture videos, while deep approach score, course grade, and level of comfort with technology were not. This study confirms that student use of lecture capture is related to their perception of topic difficulty, and demonstrates that student characteristics also influence lecture capture behaviour. Although the strength of our observed associations were weak, the level of content difficulty may be an important factor to consider when deciding when to use lecture videos as learning resources in higher education.","[McCunn, Patrick; Newton, Genevieve] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Newton, G (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",newton@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,37,1,1,4,11,CHARLES STURT UNIV,WAGGA WAGGA,"LOCKED BAG 588, WAGGA WAGGA, 2678, AUSTRALIA",1449-5554,,,AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC,Australas.

Automated assessment exercises were created for students to practice their grasp of the concepts. The online assessments and reference materials were hosted within the course learning management system, while the ML videos were accessed through a separate distance learning platform. Detailed records of students' use of the MLs, online assessment scores, exam performance, prior academic performance, and demographic variables were gathered. This data was compared to results for students in two previously taught sections who served as controls for the study. Although preliminary data indicates that the focused modules have been helpful to some students, data results overall were inconclusive in demonstrating improved learning outcomes across the board for students in the targeted course.

To describe the shift to an asynchronous online approach for pedagogy instruction within a pharmacy resident teaching program offered by a dual-campus college. Design. The pedagogy instruction component of the teaching program (Part I) was redesigned with a focus on the content, delivery, and coordination of the learning environment. Asynchronous online learning replaced distance technology or lecture capture. Using a pedagogical content knowledge framework, residents participated in self-paced online learning using faculty recordings, readings, and discussion board activities. A learning management system was used to assess achievement of learning objectives and participation prior to progressing to the teaching experiences component of the teaching program (Part II). Assessment. Evaluation of resident pedagogical knowledge development and participation in Part I of the teaching program was achieved through the learning management system. Participant surveys and written reflections showed general satisfaction with the online learning environment. Future considerations include addition of a live orientation session and increased faculty presence in the online learning environment. Conclusion. An online approach framed by educational theory can be an effective way to provide pedagogy instruction within a teaching program.","[Garrison, Gina Daubney; Baia, Patricia; Canning, Jacquelyn E.; Strang, Aimee F.] Albany Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Albany, NY USA","Garrison, GD (reprint author), 106 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208 USA.",gina.garrison@acphs.edu,"Strang, Aimee/A-5493-2017","Strang, Aimee/0000-0001-8805-3673",,,,24,4,4,1,3,AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY,ALEXANDRIA,"1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA",0002-9459,1553-6467,,AM J PHARM EDUC,Am.

The volume and length of these recorded lectures however make them difficult to navigate. Research shows that students primarily watch the recorded lectures while preparing for their exams. They do watch the full recorded lectures, but review only the parts that are relevant to them. While doing so, they often lack the required mechanisms to locate efficiently those parts of the recorded lecture that they want to view. In this paper, we describe an experiment where expert tagging is used as a means to facilitate the students' search. In the experiment, 255 students had the option to use tags to navigate 18 recorded lectures. We used the data tracked by the lecture capture system to analyze the use of the tags by the students. We compared these data to students who did not use the tagging interface (TI). Results show that the use of the TI increases in time. Students use the TI more actively over time while reducing the amount of video that they view. The experiment also shows that students who use the TI score higher grades when compared with students who use the regular interface.","[Gorissen, Pierre] Fontys Univ Appl Sci, Educ Dev & Res Dept, NL-5600 AH Eindhoven, Netherlands; [van Bruggen, Jan] Open Univ Netherlands OUNL, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Jochems, Wim] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Educ, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands","Gorissen, P (reprint author), Fontys Univ Appl Sci, POB 347, NL-5600 AH Eindhoven, Netherlands.",p.gorissen@fontys.nl,,,,,,27,0,0,1,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

There is no opportunity for interaction, and the length of the lecture is often detrimental to the student experience as the human brain cannot retain more than a small percentage of information relayed over such a long time span. Cardiff University's School of Healthcare Sciences (HCARE) has developed a number of online lecture capture resources for students, but using an interactive approach. Footage is broken into a series of fifteen to twenty minute chunks, with interactive elements such as quizzes, drag and drop activities and text input areas (where students can record thoughts and feedback) placed between each 'chunk'. Once students have worked through a film clip and its associated activities (thereby self-assessing what they have learnt) they can move on to the next clip, and so on. At the start of the activity students can download any presentation slides used in the lecture and at the end students are given links to relevant websites and to a lecture-based discussion forum where students can comment, ask and even answer peers' questions. Fora such as this also assist in eradicating any sense of isolation an online student may feel, as it becomes the digital backbone of an asynchronous community.","[Ferriday, Rebecca] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales","Ferriday, R (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-606-5763-7,INTED PROC,,,2015,,,,,,,657,661,,,,5,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BH1XF,WOS:000398586300101,,No,,,29/11/2017

Technological advances have become an important feature of universities' plans to improve the flexibility and accessibility in a learning and teaching environment. For private universities, which are market-driven, it is vital to assess if these technologies influence the perceptions and behaviour of their target beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach - The study is designed using a causal research design to examine the cause-effect relationship between the study variables. The study sample consists of 398 students selected via purposive sampling. Data are collected using a five-point Likert scale covering UTAUT2's factors and variables featuring ReWIND's acceptance and usage. Partial least squares-based structural equation modelling is used to analyse the data. Findings - The findings show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, price-value, hedonic motivation and habit have significant influence on students' acceptance and usage of ReWIND. Research limitations/implications - This research examines the factors affecting students' acceptance and usage of ReWIND in a Malaysian university. The main limitation of this study is that it focuses only on the factors highlighted in the UTAUT2 model. Practical implications - The results provide a useful framework to the universities for the successful implementation of student-friendly technologies such as ReWIND to enhance their learning experience. Originality/value - Responding to the need of studies validating the UTAUT2 model in the adoption and use of different technologies, this study contributes to the literature by extending the UTAUT2 into the context of LCS at a private university in a developing country.","[Nair, Pradeep Kumar] Taylors Univ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Ali, Faizan] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Leong, Lim Chee] Taylors Univ, INTELLECT, Subang Jaya, Malaysia","Ali, F (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",faizanali7@hotmail.co.uk,,"Ali, Faizan/0000-0003-4528-3764",,,,63,3,3,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-5659,1758-8510,,INTERACT TECHNOL SMA,Interact.

Students self-enrolled in either a traditional in-class lecture-discussion section or a fully online section of a required political research course. The class sessions from the in-class section were recorded and provided asynchronously to the online students. The instructor, course assignments, exams, and supplemental materials were the same for the in-class and online sections. The two types of sections were compared on course-embedded academic performance measures and on the completion rates of the course and of the course assignments, controlling for prior cumulative grade point average (GPA), prior credits completed, and gender. The mean overall course score for the online students was slightly, but significantly, lower than scores for the in-class students. The students' GPAs interacted with the type of section such that the difference between in-class and online academic performance diminished or disappeared among students with higher GPAs. Completion rates for the course and for assignments were significantly lower for online students. Strategies for addressing these problems through greater student engagement are widely cited, but recent empirical tests of these strategies have not provided satisfactory results.","[Roberts, James C.] Towson Univ, Polit Sci, Towson, MD USA","Roberts, JC (reprint author), Towson Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",jroberts@towson.edu,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1551-2169,1551-2177,,J POLITICAL SCI EDUC,J.

Analysis results indicate that, while the three video lecture types enhance learning performance, learning performance with lecture capture and picture-in-picture types is superior to that associated with the voice-over type. Verbalizers and visualizers achieve the same learning performance with the three video types. Additionally, sustained attention induced by the voice-over type is markedly higher than that with the picture-in-picture type. Sustained attention of verbalizers is also significantly higher than that of visualizers when learning with the three video lectures. Moreover, the positive and negative emotions induced by the three video lectures do not appear to significantly differ from each other. Also, cognitive load related to the voice-over type is significantly higher than that with by the lecture capture and picture-in-picture types. Furthermore, the cognitive load for visualizers markedly exceeds that of verbalizers who are presented with the voice-over type. Results of this study significantly contribute to efforts to design of video lectures and also provide a valuable reference when selecting video lecture types for online learning.

A related challenge is the increasing diversity of the student body in terms of socio-economic background, learning styles, English language ability and preparedness. This paper explores ways in which traditional face-to-face teaching methods (such as lectures and tutorials) can be combined with online teaching and learning activities in a ""blended"" learning approach to improve teaching and learning and to accommodate student diversity. Using a large first year Economics class as a case study, data were collected on student perceptions of the use of blended learning. A statistical model was used on a sample of 50 students to determine which online activities were most beneficial in improving student performance. The majority of students agreed that replacing one lecture a week with online activities and resources improved their learning, although about 20 % of the class would have preferred more lecturing and fewer online resources. Statistical finding showed that more active online resources, such as multiple choice and graphing questions, were most beneficial in improving student performance, but that more passive lecture capture was also useful in modelling the discourse of the discipline.","Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Snowball, JD (reprint author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",j.snowball@ru.ac.za,"Snowball, Jen/D-8887-2017","Snowball, Jen/0000-0001-7497-6653",,,,29,2,2,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

In this work, we consider not just the broad effect of lecture capture technology on academic achievement between cohorts, but whether this effect is related to patterns of viewership among learners. At the centre of our interest is determining whether there are strategies learners take in their reviewing of content week-to-week that may result in better achievement. To investigate this, we describe a method for modelling learners based on their interactions with lecture capture systems. Unlike investigations done by others, our models emerge from the activities of the learners themselves, and are based on the results of applying unsupervised machine learning (clustering) techniques to student viewership data. These models describe five different classifications of learner interactions, and we show that one of these is positively correlated with academic achievement. We further validate our results through repeated experimentation, and describe how such models might be used by early-alert systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: This study sought to understand faculty's experience of using a new lecture capture system. Design and Setting: This qualitative study used Kruger's systematic approach to explore undergraduate nursing faculty's first-time experience using a lecture capture system purchased by the university. Method: Four focus groups were conducted with a total of fourteen undergraduate faculty using lecture capture for the first-time. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed by the researchers. Results: Four themes were identified from the faculty interviews. Two of the themes expressed faculty's concerns about the teaching role, and two themes expressed the faculty's concerns about student learning. Conclusion: Participants experienced stress when learning to use the new lecture capture technology and struggled to resolve it with their own beliefs and teaching values. The impact of lecture capture on student learning, impact on class attendance, and the promotion of a culture of lecturing were revealed as important issues to consider when lecture capture becomes available.

In an experiment in which students were learning using each of those two types of learning materials, a slight yet unsignificant difference was observed in favour of learning from rich lecture captures. Students' survey responses indicated they prefer rich lecture captures for learning and that their availability would not necessarily have a negative impact on students' live lecture attendance rates. These results suggest that even though students prefer rich lecture capture materials for learning, they did not prove to be more efficient in achieving the desired learning outcomes.

Two hundred and twenty two students and 35 faculty members participated in the first study, which surveyed respondents regarding their perception of lecture-capture use and impact on learning. Four hundred and ninety one students participated in the second study, which compared scores on a standardized test of basic science knowledge among groups experiencing various levels of lecture-capture implementation. Students were most likely to view captured lectures in courses that moved quickly, relied heavily on lecture, were perceived as highly relevant to their future success, and contained information not available in other formats. A greater percentage of students than faculty perceived lecture capture as beneficial to learning. Higher views of captured lectures were associated with higher test scores in disciplines that relied most heavily on a straight-lecture teaching approach and had a basic science - research teaching context. The number of lecture-capture views was not significantly related to test scores in disciplines that relied less heavily on straight lecture for instruction and had a basic science - applied teaching context.

To examine faculty members' and students' use and perceptions of lecture recordings in a previously implemented lecture-capture initiative. Methods. Patterns of using lecture recordings were determined from software analytics, and surveys were conducted to determine awareness and usage, effect on attendance and other behaviors, and learning impact. Results. Most students and faculty members were aware of and appreciated the recordings. Students' patterns of use changed as the novelty wore off. Students felt that the recordings enhanced their learning, improved their in-class engagement, and had little effect on their attendance. Faculty members saw little difference in students' grades or in-class engagement but noted increased absenteeism. Conclusion. Students made appropriate use of recordings to support their learning, but faculty members generally did not make active educational use of the recordings. Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of lecture recordings on attendance.

At the end of the semester, student usage of the lecture replay and online homework systems was compared to course performance as measured by course grade and by a standardized final exam. Additionally, an attitudinal survey was used to assess the relative value students placed on each tool. While each tool received positive feedback, use of the tablet PC during lecture was rated the highest for enhancing learning and teaching effectiveness. Not surprisingly, students who completed most or all of the homework performed better than students who did not. Student usage of the lecture replay ranged from zero to over 30 h of viewing time. It was noted that international and ESL students were among the most voracious users of the lecture replay. Extensive use of the lecture replay did not correlate with course performance, as those who used this tool most heavily tended to place in the B-C grade brackets. The combination of the three tools appears to have a positive impact on retention compared with previous semesters, as 90% of students successfully completed this course.","Murray State Univ, Dept Chem, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Revell, KD (reprint author), Murray State Univ, Dept Chem, Murray, KY 42071 USA.",krevell@murraystate.edu,,,,,,7,12,12,3,24,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0021-9584,1938-1328,,J CHEM EDUC,J.

Although students had favorable views of the lecture capture technology and thought it should be available campus wide, few actually viewed the recordings, and those who did used them mainly as a substitute rather than a supplement to face-to-face lectures. More importantly, the class with lecture recordings available had significantly lower attendance rates and course achievement (final grades), and attendance mediated the relationship between class section and achievement. Further analyses showed that the negative effects of offering lecture recordings were not global; instead, lecture recording availability appeared to increase nonparticipation (in exams, class activities, and assignments) in a select group of students.

Particle transport, deposition and removal occur in many natural and industrial processes. Microelectronic, imaging and pharmaceutical industries are a few examples for which particle transport, deposition and removal play key roles. Diverse areas from air pollution, sand storms land landslide to xerography and Chemical-Mechanical polishing in microelectronic fabrications involve particle transport, deposition and removal. A series of courses were developed to make the new important research findings available to seniors and first year graduate students in engineering departments through specialized curricula. This course series involved integration of numerical simulations and experiments in the curriculum and are composed of four modules: Fundamentals of particle transport, dispersion, deposition, and removal. Computational modeling of particle transport, deposition, and removal. Experimental study of particle transport, deposition, and removal, and aerosol instrumentation. Industrial applications of particle transport, deposition, and removal. The materials for the course sequence were made available on the web and these full semester courses were taught six times each (over six years) and were taught twice at two campuses simultaneously. More recently, the course sequence was also offered simultaneously in house and on-line using lecture capture facilities. The purpose of this presentation is to provide information about the effectiveness of using web-based modules for enhanced learning of the in-class material and inform the audience about the availability of the course material for use at other institutions. (All course materials are posted on line and is available free of charge.) Assessment of usability of course web and of student learning through their projects and course grades was also presented and discussed.","[Ahmadi, Goodarz] Clarkson Univ, Dept Mech & Aeronaut Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA","Ahmadi, G (reprint author), Clarkson Univ, Dept Mech & Aeronaut Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION,WASHINGTON,"1818 N STREET, NW SUITE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2153-5965,,,ASEE ANNU CONF EXPO,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,11,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BF6XU,WOS:000383779802031,,No,,,29/11/2017

Current and future students are now ""digital natives"" interacting with the world and absorbing information in a very ""YouTube"" style, characterized by short, on-demand, and entertaining chunks of information. Faculty have been reticent to adopt what they perceive to be unproven technologies while administrators often are unable to allow faculty extra time or budget to investigate the efficacy of new approaches to teaching. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to help improve this situation by accessing the effectiveness of two key online modalities that are often the easiest first steps for faculty to adopt and can be very effective in improving the operational effectiveness and learning outcomes of the course: Recorded lectures and Online Quizzes. Recorded lectures and Quizzes were integrated into two undergraduate engineering courses. The two courses were a sophomore level Dynamics class and a senior level Finite Element Analysis course. The Dynamics course is required and the enrollments range from 160-360, and the Finite Element Analysis course is an elective with enrollments between 60-80. In the Dynamics course, recorded lectures were often used in place of the live lecture and the in-class lecture time was often ""flipped"" and used for discussion and interaction rather than a traditional one-way lecture. In the Finite Element Analysis course, the lectures were recorded and made available to the students prior to the in-class version of the lecture. Quizzes were designed as an assessment tool (rather than purely for grading) aimed at ""real time"" feedback. This allowed both students and instructors to measure the learning achievements in the previous week of the course and let the instructor modify the subsequent week's lectures accordingly. The results show that student-reported learning efficiency improves when recorded lectures are utilized. This was the case whether the class period was subsequently used to teach a similar lecture or if lecture time was flipped to provide more interactive discussion based learning. The availability of recorded lectures prior to class did not affect students' decision to attend class. Students reported that having weekly ""low stakes"" quizzes and reviewing them in class helped them understand key concepts better. These results provide more evidence of an ever increasing amount of data that supports the learning efficiency gains that can be attained using a variety of hybrid course pedagogy and online learning modalities. The debate over the need to adjust teaching methodologies based on the prominence of Digital Natives within undergraduate college courses has continued since the term originated (Presnky, 2001) early in this millennium. Recent studies have focused this debate away from the terminology and towards those activities that can help improve learning outcomes for students not easily described by a single term. It is important to consider the nature of how students interact with the world around them terms of behavior, learning styles, and use of technology. Students have indeed changed in the past two decades and adapting to those changes improves learning outcomes and student satisfaction. Regardless of the technology utilized, students still prefer Blended/Hybrid classes that employ a course website to compliment live class meetings. In a recent study of over 112,000 undergraduate students, a majority (57.7%) indicated that their preferred type of courses were those that had some online components. Only 22.1 % of these students preferred courses with no online components and a very small 7.8% preferred online only courses (Allen, 2013). In the same study, students reported lecture capture as their number one priority for faculty to use more of in the future. Students also report that having some control of the pace of learning can help them be more effective (Wibee, 2011). This study was designed to address the changing needs of students and their stated preferences related to their use of recorded lectures and online quizzes in hybrid STEM classes. This paper summarizes some initial qualitative results that are part of a broader and more quantitative study that is planned for the 2014-2015 school years. There is still some variation in the use and definition of term such as ""blended"" and ""hybrid"" in related research. To be clear, in this study the term ""hybrid"" is used to describe courses which have live, face-to-face meetings in a physical classroom each week and include a significant amount of additional materials as well as technical and procedural innovations available from the course website. This includes ""flipping"" the classroom in which lectures are recorded but students still attend live class for discussion of the material and other active learning activities.","[Dimas, David J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Jabbari, Faryar] Univ Calif Irvine, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Irvine, CA USA; [Billimek, John] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Hlth Policy Res Inst, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Dimas, DJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION,WASHINGTON,"1818 N STREET, NW SUITE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2153-5965,,,ASEE ANNU CONF EXPO,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,15,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BF6XW,WOS:000383780003065,,No,,,29/11/2017

The primary aim of the current study is to document students' perceptions, actual pattern of usage, and impact of use of LRS on students' grade in a dental gross and neuroanatomy course. Other aims are to determine if students' learning preference correlated with final grades and to see if other factors like gender, age, overall academic score on the Dental Aptitude Test (DAT), lecture levels of difficulty, type of lecture, category of lecture, or teaching faculty could explain the impact, if any, of the use of LRS on the course final grade. No significant correlation was detected between the final grades and the variables studied except for a significant but modest correlation between final grades and the number of times the students accessed the lecture recordings (r=0.33 with P=0.01). Also, after adjusting for gender, age, learning style, and academic DAT, a significant interaction between auditory and average usage time was found for final grade (P=0.03). Students who classified themselves as auditory and who used the LRS on average for fewer than 10 minutes per access, scored an average final grade of 16.43 % higher than the nonauditory students using the LRS for the same amount of time per access.

The authors wondered whether in-person attendance affects how students evaluate lecturers. Method This is a retrospective review of faculty evaluations completed by first- and second-year medical students at the Ohio State University College of Medicine during 2009-2010. Lecture-capture technology was used to record all lectures. Attendance at lectures was optional; however, all students were required to complete lecturer evaluation forms. Students rated overall instruction using a five-option response scale. They also reported their attendance. The authors used analysis of variance to compare the lecturer ratings of attendees versus nonattendees. The authors included additional independent variablesyear of student, student grade/rank in class, and lecturer degreein the analysis. Results The authors analyzed 12,092 evaluations of 220 lecturers received from 358 students. The average number of evaluations per lecturer was 55. Seventy-four percent (n = 8,968 evaluations) of students attended the lectures they evaluated, whereas 26% (n = 3,124 evaluations) viewed them online. Mean lecturer ratings from attendees was 3.85 compared with 3.80 by nonattendees (P .05; effect size: 0.055). Student's class grade and year, plus lecturer degree, also affected students' evaluations of lecturers (effect sizes: 0.055-0.3). Conclusions Students' attendance at lectures, year, and class grade, as well as lecturer degree, affect students' evaluation of lecturers. This finding has ramifications on how student evaluations should be collected, interpreted, and used in promotion and tenure decisions in this evolving medical education environment.","[Martin, Stanley I.; Nagel, Rollin; Davis, John A.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Div Infect Dis, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Martin, Stanley I.; Vandre, Dale D.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Integrated Pathway Curriculum, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Way, David P.; Nagel, Rollin] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Educ & Scholarship, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Verbeck, Nicole; Davis, John A.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Vandre, Dale D.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Cell Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Martin, SI (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, N1135 Doan Hall,410 W 10th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",stanley.martin@osumc.edu,"Martin, Stanley/E-3600-2011",,,,,14,6,6,3,13,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1040-2446,,,ACAD MED,Acad.

Learning, as the result of a lecture, greatly depends on the subject, the competence and abilities of the lecturer as well as on other transient causes. However, lectures also have some intrinsic deficiencies as a teaching method pertinent to their very nature. In order to fully understand the teaching value of lectures and their role and proper use in educational systems, their deficiencies have been studied in a theoretical analysis from the perspective of cognitive learning theories. Fifteen deficiencies have been identified and clustered in three categories based on root causes of deficiencies: synchronicity problems, time constraint and individual student abilities, needs and knowledge. These findings can be used to adjust expected learning outcomes of lectures, to properly (re)design lecture content and process and to design other learning and teaching activities that would compensate and complement lectures. Recommendations are given on replacing and amending lectures with other instructional methods, amending lectures in the course of delivery with additional content and tools and complementing lectures after delivery with content, tools and activities. Suggestions on the use of information technology that could substitute, reduce or eliminate at least some of the deficiencies are made. Lecture captures seem to be valuable supplement for live lectures compensating in all three categories of deficiencies. Suggestions and directions for further research are given.","Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Dept Elect Syst & Informat Proc, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Pale, P (reprint author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Dept Elect Syst & Informat Proc, Unska 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",predrag.pale@fer.hr,,,,,,65,1,1,2,10,COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM,ZAGREB,"INST ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH, GAJEVA 32, PO BOX 290, HR-10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA",0350-6134,,,COLLEGIUM ANTROPOL,Coll.

The tutorials changed from ""chalk talks"" in the first semester to a lecture capture format in the second in which PowerPoint slides, ink annotations, and associated audio were recorded, and uploaded online to be viewable by any student at any time. As expected, the later format reached more students, though fewer came in person to the live tutorial. In an effort to continue to reach as many students as possible, while at the same time providing a more engaging environment for students at the live event, the format changed once more. Demonstrations, discussions, and other personalized interactions not accessible online were incorporated in the third semester to provide a more meaningful experience for students physically present, without compromising the online content. This third tutorial format in the final semester did indeed encourage more students to come in person. Herein, we follow the evolution of these tutorials, discuss the impetus for changing formats, document student use (both online and in person) and conclude that lecture capture technology is an effective means of delivering optional course content and it can be effectively supplemented by demonstrations and other personalized interactions to reach students with different learning styles.","[Hudson, Reuben; Luska, Kylie.

Here we describe a study to evaluate student use of lecture recordings and quantify their impact on academic performance. Questionnaire responses and online monitoring of student's access to recordings indicate that similar to 75% students use this material, the majority in a targeted manner. In contrast, a small subset of students (similar to 5%) are highly dependent on recordings downloading every lecture, and viewing the material for long periods, such that this represents a large proportion of their independent study. This 'high user' group is atypical, as it contains a high proportion of dyslexic and Non-English Speaking Background students. Despite high usage, lecture recordings do not have a significant impact on academic performance, either across the cohort or with students that use the recordings. Overall, this approach appears to be beneficial, but may reduce lecture attendance and encourage surface learning approaches in a minority of students. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, no camera operator is necessary during recording. We succeeded in implementing a cost-effective system without expensive hardware components for capturing a high-definition video signal.

However, many of our students report that this is much less engaging than in-person lectures, especially given the amount of interactive work such as ""think-pair-share"" problems done in many astronomy classes. Students have similarly criticized direct lecture-capture. To address this, we have developed a set of PowerPoint-style presentations with embedded lecture audio combined with prompts for student interaction including think-pair-share questions. These are formatted PDF packages that can be used on a range of different computers using free software. The presentations are first developed using Microsoft PowerPoint software. Audio recordings of scripted lectures are then synchronized with the presentations and the entire package is converted to PDF using Adobe Presenter. This approach combines the ease of editing that PowerPoint provides along with the platform-independence of PDF. It's easy to add, remove, or edit individual slides as needed, and PowerPoint supports internal links so that think-pair-share questions can be inserted with links to feedback based on the answers selected. Modern PDF files support animated visuals with synchronized audio and they can be read using widely available free software. Using these files students in an online course can get many of the benefits of seeing and hearing the course material presented in an in-person lecture format. Students needing extra help in traditional lecture classes can use these presentations to help review the materials covered in lecture. Finally, the presentations can be used in a ""flipped"" format in which students work through the presentations outside of class time while spending the ""lecture"" time on in-class interaction.","[Kary, David M.] Citrus Community Coll, Glendora, CA 91741 USA","Kary, DM (reprint author), Citrus Community Coll, 1000 W Foothill Blvd, Glendora, CA 91741 USA.",,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,ASTRONOMICAL SOC PACIFIC,SAN FRANCISCO,"390 ASHTON AVE, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94112 USA",,,978-1-58381-830-5,ASTR SOC P,,,2013,473,,,,,,201,206,,,,6,"Astronomy & Astrophysics; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Astronomy & Astrophysics; Education & Educational Research,BJH30,WOS:000328179100027,,No,,,29/11/2017

Upper-level administrators and information technology professionals were also interviewed to ascertain overall technology goals and identify criteria used to adopt new classroom technologies. Results. Four hundred sixty-six students, 124 faculty members, and 12 administrators participated in the survey. The most frequently used and valued types of classroom technology were course management systems, audience response systems, and lecture capture. Faculty members and students agreed that faculty members appropriately used course management systems and audience response systems. Compared with their counterparts, tech-savvy, and male students reported significantly greater preference for increased use of classroom technology. Eighty-six percent of faculty members reported having changed their teaching methodologies to meet student needs, and 91% of the students agreed that the use of technology met their needs. Conclusions. Pharmacy colleges and schools use a variety of technologies in their teaching methods, which have evolved to meet the needs of the current generation of students.

This paper looks into the use of Wikipedia to dynamically adapt language models for scholarly speech. We propose Ranked Word Correct Rate as a new metric better aligned with the goals of improving transcript searchability and specialist word recognition.

The flipped model of learning has transformed teaching practice by changing traditional roles and increasing interaction between the instructor and students during class. In the flipped classroom, the blended learning strategies transfer the responsibility and ownership of learning from the teacher to the students through participation in active learning activities [1]. The empirical evidence for active learning, defined as any instructional method that engages students in the learning process, is extensive [2]. New developments in cognitive science challenge traditional notions of teaching, learning and retention. Cognitive scientists have determined that people's short-term memory is very limited and can only process so much information at once [3]. The vast amount of information presented in a typical lecture comes at students too fast and is quickly forgotten. Designing experiences that encourage students to transform into active learners rather than passive repositories of information is essential [4]. In the flipped instructional model, lectures occur outside of the classroom so students learn the material prior to coming into class. In class time is then freed up to discuss complex topics and work with students either individually or in small groups, increased in-class student problem solving with immediate feedback occurs, and adaption of content and class discussion to meet current level of students learning is possible [5]. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the impact of the flipped classroom instructional model on occupational therapy student learning outcomes and perceptions in a traditional theory course. The pre and post competency and critical thinking outcomes demonstrated increased retention and application of theoretical constructs in flipped classroom students as compared to those students who received instruction in the traditional classroom format.","[Silveira, Jeramie] Salem State Univ, Salem, MA USA","Silveira, J (reprint author), Salem State Univ, Salem, MA USA.",,,,,,,20,0,0,2,3,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",,,978-84-616-3847-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,5977,5981,,,,5,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BE8BW,WOS:000376253200012,,No,,,29/11/2017

REC:all is a project funded with support from the European Commission under the Lifelong Learning Programme, that studies how lectures are currently being captured and used in the institutions involved in the project and the wider European High Education Community. The aim of REC: all is to explore new ways in which lecture capture can become more pedagogically valuable and engaging, and is investigating a variety of learning design, technical and legal issues. By exploring student and teacher needs REC: all is developing guidelines for teachers to enable innovative and interactive educational designs that exploit the potential of this new technology. The REC: all project brings together experts in five EU countries who are already actively using lecture capture, in order to exchange ideas, research case studies, co-develop guidelines for the community and develop an active network of practitioners. Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV) is one of the institutions involved in REC: all project. UPV has long experience in video capture, and has developed an institutional system called Polimedia for creating multimedia contents. UPV is also well known for adopting new teaching methods that promote a more active, practical and critical learning process in accordance with the demands of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). In this communication two case studies of effective use of lecture capture are presented. These case studies have been conducted at UPV under the framework of REC: all project, with the aim of developing transferable and practical pedagogical models and reference benchmarks of good practice. Each case study will describe the pedagogical context, the educational design, and how lecture capture influences the delivery format. Organizational aspects will also be considered such as: what educational support is needed and where this should be placed, what is desirable with respect to the training of teachers and support staff.

Analysis by the United States Department of Education shows 78% of all American higher education institutions offer remedial courses. Over 20% of all entering students enroll in one or more developmental courses. Twenty-four percent are admitted into at least one remedial mathematics course. 17% take at least one writing course; 13% enroll in at least one reading course. Many critics find that remediation programs are too expensive to fund at the taxpayers' expense and do not improve persistence or completion rates. Funding estimates for such programs are as high as $2 billion per year. The Higher Education Act of 1985 specifies the amount of federal aid designated for funding developmental activities yet it does not mandate how programs are provided. This article examines e-learning paradigms that could increase the efficacy of remediation programs while reducing the cost to the university system. To begin, the most promising e-learning techniques are reviewed: lecture capture technology and Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs), programs that enable students to acquire, store, and retain targeted instructional materials for ongoing competency-based development.

The promise of proponents of e-learning is that learning no longer needs to be a passive experience-e-learning makes learning an active experience with emphasis on interactivity or learning by doing. In recognizing and embracing the transformative potential of e-learning, Taylor's University, a 44-year old institution has developed a 5-year e-learning strategic plan in which e-learning will play an important role in equipping graduates with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st-century digital economy. The plan proposes to restructure current learning environments and methodologies, including the proposition of an e-learning mission statement, guiding principles, goals, strategies, success measures and key responsibilities. The aim is that by 2015 all Taylor's students will be able to ""learn anytime and anywhere"". The paper elaborates how the e-learning strategic plan is embedded institutionally as 'blended learning', which adopts a strategic and systematic implementation of technology combined with the best features of face-to-face interaction to integrate different modes of delivery, models of teaching and styles of learning. The plan will systematically create a virtual learning environment (VLE) which encompasses technology enhanced curricula, a robust learning management system, development of course homepages, lecture capture, collaborative classrooms, and superior information technology infrastructure that will facilitate between 30% through up to 80% of learning take place thorugh online means. The plan also dwells on the willingness and ability of current faculty to adopt e-learning. This will be the critical factor determining the success or failure of the implementation of e-learning at the university. The plan proposes the setting up of an e-learning Academy and a corollary Teaching Enhancement Plan (TEP) that will operationalize Taylor's commitment to improve faculty competencies through professional development and training. The paper finally ends with an analysis of responses from students and staff on the various initiatives introduced and future measures to be taken to integrate e-learning throughout the entire fabric of Taylor's so that it remains a competitive institution of higher learning for future generations.","[Nair, P.; Yao, A.; Ramchand, T.] Taylors Univ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia",,pradeep.n@taylors.edu.my; yao.adrian@taylors.edu.my; tarana.gr@taylors.edu.my,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-616-2661-8,INTED PROC,,,2013,,,,,,,6386,6396,,,,11,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BB8IX,WOS:000346699806054,,No,,,29/11/2017

The superficially simple idea of providing access to lectures at the students own pace and location is leading to surprising innovation. Institutions are beginning to build extensive libraries of recorded material. These are already being reused for contentbased marketing, raising the institutional profile by allowing external access to teaching and learning events, and providing a route to more flexible, distance and blended modes of learning such as 'flipping'. The REC: all (www.recall.info) project has been investigating these changes and how such material can be repurposed and augmented.

There is extreme debate on the effect of lecture capture on student attendance included in the research. Methods: Two surveys were compiled, one each for students and faculty. These were distributed by email to the entire student body and all full-time and part-time faculty. Responses were voluntary. The questions sought to identify the priorities of the participant, reasons for viewing lectures compiled by course, to assess any effect on class attendance and to evaluate the ease and use of the technical function. There was also a section for subjective responses and suggestions. Results: The tabulations proved a very high use of the program with the most important reason being to prepare for exams. The question of class attendance is still open to interpretation. Technically, the Mediasite system was ranked easy to use by both groups. Conclusions: The results of this survey confirm the concept of lecture capture as an integral segment of advanced education. Though this system should not replace class attendance, it is a vital supplement to course work and study. By reviewing all of the components of the survey those who may have concerns on its effectiveness are also aware of the advantages. The results of this study met all the objectives to evaluate use and obtain viewpoints to improve and expand the program.

We examined patterns of online lecture use by our students and related that use to academic entry measures, gender and examination performance. Detailed access records identified by student were available from server logs. Total views per page of lecture material increased over the first six years, then decreased markedly between years seven and eight, possibly due to the recent availability of alternate forms of lecture audio. Lecture use peaked in midafternoon and again in the evening, although some use was seen at all hours. Usage was highest at midweek and lowest on Fridays as might be expected. Individual student's use varied widely from rates equivalent to less than one viewing/page to more than three viewings per page. Overall use by male students was greater than that of females and gender-specific differences in the daily pattern were seen. Lecture use was correlated to the Medical College Admission Test (R) (MCAT (R)) Verbal Reasoning and Physical Sciences scores but not to composite MCAT scores or undergraduate grade point average. Overall use appeared to be driven by scheduled team-based learning (TBL) sessions and major examinations. Specific subsets of lecture material were most often viewed before related TBL sessions and again during review for examinations. A small but significant correlation between lecture use and examination and course performance was seen, specifically in the male student population. These findings, along with earlier observations, suggest that varied use of online lectures is attributable to multiple factors. Anat Sci Educ 5: 311-320.

Design A descriptive, online survey undertaken during weeks 8-10 of semester one in May, 2010. Setting An Australian University in Brisbane, South-East Queensland. Subjects 128 first-year students enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing Program. Main outcome measure Student experiences of Lecture Capture measured by a 14-item survey developed for the evaluation. Results Students largely perceived Lecture Capture to be useful in aiding understanding and learning, both during the course and in preparation for assessment. It particularly helped the two older groups of students (22-30 & >30 years) understand lectures and revise content at their own pace. Lecture Capture assisted first-year students in adjusting to university life, and this was most noticeable for the youngest group of respondents (<19 years). On-line lectures helped students become familiar with the program's websites and web resources and provided an opportunity to practice note-taking. With the exception of those aged 22-30, Lecture Capture was not regarded as a more effective use of time than face-to-face lectures. Predominantly, students would have preferred face-to-face lectures with optional Lecture Capture, and this was strongest amongst the two older groups. Students overwhelming noted satisfaction when live lectures became available from week four. Conclusions Findings support the use of web-based digital lecture technology during the initial weeks of university for first-year Bachelor of Nursing students, but indicate this should be to supplement, rather than replace, traditional face-to-face lectures.","[Cooke, Marie] Griffith Univ, Res Ctr Clin & Community Practice Dev, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Cooke, Marie; Watson, Bernadette; Blacklock, Edward; Mansah, Martha; Howard, Matylda; Johnston, Amy; Tower, Marion] Griffith Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Johnston, Amy] Griffith Univ, Eskitis Inst Cell & Mol Therapies, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Murfield, Jenny] Griffith Univ, Res Ctr Community & Clin Practice Innovat, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Cooke, M (reprint author), Griffith Univ, Res Ctr Clin & Community Practice Dev, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",m.cooke@griffith.edu.au; bernadette.m.watson@griffith.edu.au; eblacklock@griffith.edu.au; m.mansah@griffith.edu.au; matylda.howard@griffith.edu.au; a.johnston@griffith.edu.au; m.tower@griffith.edu.au; j.murfield@griffith.edu.au,"Tower, Marion/L-1236-2013; Watson, Bernadette/H-7682-2016","Tower, Marion/0000-0002-8922-0047; Watson, Bernadette/0000-0001-5381-1390; Murfield, Jenny/0000-0001-9595-4242; Cooke, Marie/0000-0002-9928-4685",,,,17,12,12,0,7,AUSTRALIAN NURSING FEDERATION,KINGSTON,"PO BOX 4239, KINGSTON, ACT 2604, AUSTRALIA",0813-0531,,,AUST J ADV NURS,Aust.

The project's goals include the integration of SMART Boards in on-ground classrooms, capturing lectures for immediate student use (e. g., reviewing content), and developing a video library of lectures for embedding in online courses. This presentation will provide an overview of the project and a review of its status. College classrooms of today are often present on computer monitors, iPads, and Smart Phones of the students. In order to keep students engaged, professional educators need to utilize the technologies of the digital age to capture and maintain their interest [1]. When students are in the traditional face-to-face classroom environments, the use of educational technology can be instrumental in student engagement and learning [2]. The use of Smart Boards, a technology interactive whiteboard, is one tool that educators can use to increase engagement in the classroom. The ability to present content on a SMART Board and capture the lecture for online learning is step further into the digital age for most universities. By combining strong curriculum with educational technology, universities can utilize the assets of their faculty expertise to educate students in every type of educational classroom environment including face-to-face, blended, and online formats. The use of the Internet is a powerful educational tool when it provides multimedia technologies for its students [3]. Capturing and delivering the lectures of a university's professors on the web allows students to engage the learning at their convenience and pace. Enhancing the lecture capture with the use of SMART Boards can provide a multi-sensory learning experience for the instructor as well as the student. When a lecture utilizes an instructor's presence and voice with written content (e. g., PowerPoint), the multimedia content engages the cognitive structures of the students in a positive manner [3]. The study results presented by Dey et al. suggest that students prefer to see their instructors during a lecture and their learning outcomes are enhanced by lecture capture technologies that provide audio as well as visual components of the content being presented in an online format.",,,lnaffziger@nu.edu; kfawson@nu.edu,,,,,,9,0,0,1,5,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1079,,978-84-615-5563-5,INTED PROC,,,2012,,,,,,,6548,6554,,,,7,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BHQ76,WOS:000326396406070,,No,,,29/11/2017

In it a specification is considered to be evolutionary rather than fixed. From a simple initial specification, a system offering limited functionality is developed. This provides a subset of the anticipated full feature set. The prototype is then deployed and feedback from the users of the system informs and guides the development of the next iteration of the system. This mechanism contrasts with the top down, tutor centric approach taken in the development of many eLearning systems. This paper describes how the prototyping methodology was applied to inform the development of an integrated eLearning resource. This resource was initially developed to apply lecture capture technology to create a resource that allowed hearing impaired students to revisit and review captured lecture content through embedded subtitles. As the product evolved it became clear that traditional lecture capture resources available at the time did not fully meet the needs of the general student body. In particular the existing resources only addressed elements of the behaviourist and cognitivist learning theories but did not support constructivist or social constructivist learning theories. In addition they only supported certain of the learning styles identified in the literature. The authors set out to develop an eLearning system based on the initial work but within a flexible structure. This allowed enhancement and extension of the system as the feedback from its deployment was received. The paper discusses how feedback from both student and staff users was incorporated into the design process and how the development of the prototype was guided through these iterations to ensure that the application would map strongly against the core learning strategies identified in the literature. In particular it is shown how the online experiences of the students led to some of the limitations of traditional lecture capture as a tool for effective learning being overcome by the incorporation of web 2.0 related technologies into the product. This allowed the system to incorporate elements of user generated content, linkages and supporting materials to enhance the learning resource, address different learning theories and increase student engagement. The feedback from the users in the classroom environment was a critical part of the development process and the paper presents the data gathered, discusses how it was analysed and incorporated in subsequent iterations and how the prototyping model for the development of eLearning resources could be deployed more widely.","[Stewart, Iain; Devon, James; McKee, William; Harrison, David; Allan, Malcolm] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",,i.f.stewart@gcu.ac.uk; j.devon@gcu.ac.uk; w.a.mckee@gcu.ac.uk; m.allan@gcu.ac.uk; d.harrison@gcu.ac.uk,,,,,,23,0,0,1,5,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-74-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,541,551,,,,11,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BFW04,WOS:000321613000065,,No,,,29/11/2017

However, with the rise of podcasting and the increased focus on interaction as a means to engage students, current web-based lecture technologies (WBLT) are capable of much more than simply recording and distributing a live lecture. This study aimed to discover what teaching staff are currently doing, and what they would like to be doing with WBLT for learning and teaching. Data were drawn from initial focus groups conducted with 10 academic teaching staff at Swinburne University of Technology, as well as an online survey that was distributed to all Swinburne staff with a lecture capture account. Three key requirements for a university-wide WBLT system were identified: flexibility in where and when recordings can be made, flexibility in control over those recordings, and the desire to be able to interact with the recordings and incorporate them as an integral part of the course. These findings indicate that teaching staff want to innovate in their use of recordings and need to be supported to do so through the adoption of an appropriate recording solution.","[Germany, Lisa] Swinburne Univ Technol, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia","Germany, L (reprint author), Victoria Univ, Off PVC Learning & Teaching, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",Lisa.Germany@vu.edu.au,,,,,,19,2,2,3,12,ASCILITE,COMO WA,"UNIT 5, 202 COODE STREET, COMO WA, 6152, AUSTRALIA",1449-3098,,,AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC,Australas.

While this debate is ongoing, the lecture is still a common feature within most higher educational institutions. Lecture capture has been used for a number of years in many institutions to enhance and extend the usefulness of the lecture activity. It provides significant advantages for the students (Bradley 2009) but there are distinct limitations to the technologies used as they stand. In particular, many systems are designed to be used in large lecture spaces and do not lend themselves to smaller classrooms due to cost, portability and staffing issues. In addition many implementations are fixed or wide-angled and provide limited quality in terms of video standard and information retrieval. Research has shown (Woo 2008) that some of the perceived benefits of lecture capture (eg reuse for distance learning or for catch-up if a class is missed) are reduced when these technologies are used alone. In addition lecture capture (by definition) tends to record the lecture as a standalone unit, and even when enhanced with screen capture has several limitations when intended as more than a useful revision resource. This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of several versions of lecture capture and dissemination. It then proposes a framework that uses the best features of these and extends them to support a range of different approaches to learning, from enquiry led to traditional lecture driven, by integrating the captured lecture into a learning structure where it forms one of a range of interlinked learning resources. This approach supports different learning styles, allows student interaction with the content and makes more effective use of the different learning resources, without the staff overhead that often makes the creation of such resources impractical. To underpin the concept, a number of prototype systems, which incorporate the key elements of the final system, have been developed and deployed within classroom environments. The paper presents an analysis of the results from these pilot studies from both the staff and student perspectives and shows how these results were used to develop the specification and design of the final integrated system currently under production by the authors.","[Stewart, Iain; McKee, William; Devon, James; Harrison, David; Allan, Malcolm] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",,i.f.stewart@gcu.ac.uk; w.a.mckee@gcu.ac.uk; j.devon@gcu.ac.uk; d.harrison@gcu.ac.uk; m.allan@gcu.ac.uk,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-44-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,433,444,,,,12,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BBU62,WOS:000308236800054,,No,,,29/11/2017

In this article, the issue of live lecture and lecture capture interactivity is addressed from the aspect of students' question posing. During several lectures, students were asked to write down all the questions that occurred to them, but for any reason they would not pose them out loud. As the result, more than 250 questions were acquired during 18 hours of lecturing. Acquired questions were used to gain insight into quantity and types of questions that occur to students during a lecture, to try to increase lecture interactivity by answering relevant questions on the next lecture, and to analyze students' concentration during the course of the lecture. The potential of using acquired questions in order to generate additional lecture content for rich lecture captures used by Pyramidia tool, thereby increasing captured lectures' interactivity, was also investigated.","[Petrovic, Juraj; Sovic, Ana; Cvitanovic, Mihita; Pale, Predrag; Sersic, Damir] Univ Zagreb, Dept Elect Syst & Informat Proc, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 41000, Croatia","Petrovic, J (reprint author), Univ Zagreb, Dept Elect Syst & Informat Proc, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",juraj.petrovic@fer.hr; ana.sovic@fer.hr,,,,,,17,0,0,2,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4673-2427-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BA4HU,WOS:000335746300064,,No,,,29/11/2017

Yet many of the pedagogic innovations currently being made in education are being implemented without appropriate evaluation. The purpose of this article is to report on the effectiveness of Articulate lecture capture technology as a learning tool in medical education. Method Student performance in an Articulate lecture capture-supported biochemistry course (2009) was compared to that in the previous academic year (2008). Both course iterations were identical in terms of faculty, course materials (with the exception of lecture capture in the 2009 course) and course evaluation. This biochemistry course is taught in the first semester of the first year of the Podiatric Medicine curriculum. To examine the impact of lecture capture on student performance a within-subjects design was implemented, a two way ANCOVA with repeated measures. IRB approval was received to use archival data. Results & Discussion There was no statistically significant difference between students in the two courses in terms of average age, ethnicity and gender. The use of lecture capture-supported pedagogy resulted in significantly higher student test scores, than achieved historically using traditional pedagogy. The overall course performance using this lecture capture-supported pedagogy was almost 6% higher than in the previous year, male and female students benefitted equally from the use of this technology. Non-native English language speakers benefitted more significantly from the lecture capture-supported pedagogy than native English language speakers since their performance improved by 10.0 points. This advantage was especially noticeable on the final examination. Conclusion These observations support the expanded use of lecture capture technology in other courses in the medical school curriculum. It is well documented that under-represented minority (URM) students are at increased risk of burn out, emotional exhaustion and therefore attrition. This technology could be used as part of an academic enrichment plan to reduce this attrition of URM students, a significant proportion of which are non native English language speakers. The appropriate use of this technology may therefore go some way to addressing the shortage of URMs in the Physician workforce.","[Shaw, Graham P.] Barry Univ, Sch Podiatr Med, Miami, FL 33161 USA",,gshaw@mail.barry.edu; molnar2343@gmail.com,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-695-3491-5,EDULEARN PROC,,,2012,,,,,,,2650,2655,,,,6,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BHP41,WOS:000326239302109,,No,,,29/11/2017

This study is an attempt to understand the relationship between student perceptions of lecture capture and academic performance in large undergraduate courses where the practice is most commonplace. Students in five large undergraduate courses (N = 439) responded to a survey on their perceptions of lecture capture used in their course and academic performance was measured by the final course grade. Results suggest that higher achieving students view recordings significantly less often than low achievers. High achievers also tend to fast forward and view certain sections of recordings only once, whereas low achievers view the entire recording multiple times. The conclusion is that lecture capture is more likely to be of benefit to low achieving students. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We used an online questionnaire to ask students how helpful enhanced podcasts were for a variety of course activities and how important having access to the enhanced podcasts was in their decision to miss classes. Student responses from two courses, one introductory and one advanced, were compared. Students in the introductory Genetics course reported that having access to enhanced podcasts was ""very important"" in their decision to miss class more often (39%) than those in the advanced Microbiology course (20%). They also reported missing more classes than students in the advanced course. Students in both courses found the enhanced podcasts helpful for a range of learning activities. First year students who missed just a few classes and those who missed many classes both found the enhanced podcasts to be very helpful for learning activities. We argue that creating these resources is a good choice for instructors irrespective of the level of the course they teach and that the potential value of these resources, particularly for first year students, outweighs any impact that having access to supplementary enhanced podcasts of the lectures may have on class attendance.","[Holbrook, Jane] Univ Waterloo, Ctr Teaching Excellence, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Dupont, Christine] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Holbrook, J (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Ctr Teaching Excellence, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",jholbroo@uwaterloo.ca,,,Centre for Teaching Excellence at the University of Waterloo,"We would like to thank the students in these two courses who took the time to respond to the questionnaire that provided the data that this work is based on, and for support from the Centre for Teaching Excellence at the University of Waterloo.",,42,15,15,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1059-0145,,,J SCI EDUC TECHNOL,J.

While there are many issues with the lecture as an educational tool, lectures are still an outcome-effective and a cost-effective way of presenting information, when it is delivered by subject experts in a structured form which supports the linear development of concepts and promotes the depth of understanding characteristic of this level of education (Heward 2003). However, the current generation of students display a lifestyle in which they are used to accessing information in a variety of modes across a range of platforms, often concurrently. (Kennedy et al, 2008). In particular they tend to prefer to work with small chunks of information and to assimilate them by relating them to other pieces of information in their own time. The challenge faced by educators is how to take advantage of the benefits of the traditional lecture approach while also gaining from the advantages of Web 2.0 technologies where user-driven discussion, user generated content, and the capability to take non linear routes through information and content can all contribute to the learning experience (Ravenscroft, 2009). While traditional Virtual Learning Environments such as Blackboard are moving towards this with the incorporation of technologies such as Wikis and blogs, there is still a rigid structure to such systems which makes it difficult to truly integrate these elements into the learning experience. The authors have worked for a number of years in the area of lecture capture, both to support students with disabilities and also to provide rich learning resources. Recent work has led to the development of a software prototype which has been applied to material designed for and gathered in a classroom environment to produce web-based, self-guided learning products. This prototype integrates a range of resources (captured lecture video, audio and presentation slides) but in addition to simply presenting this content as a passive viewing experience, many other resources including tutorials, FAQs and student feedback are used to drive the navigation through the content and to allow the students to discover and develop linkages within the content. This paper describes the evolution of the specification of the prototype, the development of the software and the feedback received from the students who utilised it. A critical analysis of this data is presented and from this the specification of the next evolution of the software is presented.","[Stewart, Iain; McKee, William; Porteous, Kevin] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",,i.f.stewart@gcu.ac.uk; w.a.mckee@gcu.ac.uk; Kevin.Porteous@gcu.ac.uk,,,,,,17,0,0,1,3,ACADEMIC CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-22-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,802,810,,,,9,Business; Education & Educational Research,Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BYT86,WOS:000300244000097,,No,,,29/11/2017

The study was undertaken among undergraduates and postgraduates in accounting at an Australian university. In addition to traditional Likert scale questions capturing the extent to which students appreciate WBLT, we introduce new valuations such as the price they are willing to pay to access WBLT. The findings revealed that the majority of students rarely used WBLT and placed a very low monetary value on them, placing into question the high percentage 'positive' and 'appreciative' feedback found in this and earlier studies. Although most students appreciate WBLT when it is perceived to be free, most are unwilling to pay for access, suggesting they are not 'truly' valued. Importantly, while most students do not value WBLT, some students value them very highly, raising issues of equity and access not captured by average values across students. Students who regularly attend face to face lectures did not use WBLT as much, and those students who rarely used WBLT were more likely to accept a $50 reduction in fees if WBLT were not made available. It appears university administrations are correctly emphasising that WBLT should not be viewed as a replacement for traditional face to face lectures.","[Taplin, Ross H.; Low, Lee Hun; Brown, Alistair M.] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Accounting, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Taplin, RH (reprint author), Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Accounting, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",r.taplin@curtin.edu.au; lee.low@cbs.curtin.edu.au; alistair.brown@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,,,,,18,15,15,0,6,ASCILITE,COMO WA,"UNIT 5, 202 COODE STREET, COMO WA, 6152, AUSTRALIA",1449-3098,,,AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC,Australas.

Students were assigned to go visit the MIT Museum. Each one had to choose one robot in the exhibit and learn about it, take pictures and/or small video clips, then present their choice in a ""virtual gallery"". Using free web creation software, they uploaded their assignments in a web site called Virtual field Trip to the MIT Museum. The idea was that someone who would use the site should get an experience comparable with visiting the museum. Students have worked as a team to also provide overall information about the museum - directions, hours, admission, general information, historic facts, etc. This has proved to be an excellent learning experience - students took ownership of this assignment, not only providing amazing pictures, video clips of themselves standing by their chosen items and explaining how they work, but providing links to web sites discussing various aspects of artificial intelligence, applications etc. They have formed this ad-hoc online community to collaborate in the process of designing the virtual field trip and have opened it to the outside world by including a blog who would allow visitors to express their opinions. My presentations will show the work in progress - the web sites created by my students using Weebly and Google docs. This presentation can be of interest to a large audience - from the faculty/instructors to the IT support staff to administrators interested in creative ways of exploring reality.","[Neamtu, Rodica] Emmanuel Coll, Boston, MA USA",,neamtur@emmanuel.edu,,,,,,6,0,0,1,4,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",,,978-84-615-3324-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,2243,2251,,,,9,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BEK53,WOS:000317080002035,,No,,,29/11/2017

A retrospective study of LRS was implemented to document the students' perceptions, pattern of usage, and impact on the students' grades in three basic sciences courses (Cell Biology/Histology, Physiology, and Neurosciences). The number of accesses and length of viewings of the recordings were recorded per week for each student and correlated with the grades in each of the three courses. Attendance records were not available. The results showed considerable variability in the use of the LRS by both faculty and students during the entire semester and across all three courses, including week to week variations. Data indicated that 30% of the students did not use the LRS at all with 41% of the students using it very little (less than 10 times for a total of 131 recordings). Specific patterns of usage were identified for each of the three courses throughout the semester, with an increase in access prior or during examination weeks. However, the statistical analysis showed that there was no correlation between the final grades and the usage of LRS. Finally, a survey of the students' perception showed that 74% agreed/strongly agreed that the recordings were useful with 6% disagreeing/strongly disagreeing and 11% undecided. This study showed that the use of LRS might be a viable alternative for students unable to attend lecture due to circumstances such as illness but that more research is needed to truly understand the best pedagogical use of LRS.

How do you keep students interested and engaged in learning during your lectures, and yet away from distracting techology (e. g., texting) during class? How can students harness computer tools to enhance their learning and improve their grades? Here we examined whether student access to PowerPoint lectures posted to Blackboard (Bb) in undergraduate Psychology courses enhanced learning as measured by final course grades and student self assessment. Students were divided into 'Low' and 'High' Bb website access, and students with 'High' Bb website access had significantly higher final course grades. Students who accessed lecture materials online outperformed students who engaged only in 'traditional' classroom learning. We also explored student grades related to Tegrity-access. Tegrity is a lecture capture system that records audio and visual lecture materials, and makes them available on Bb. Student hit rates or view time for course materials using Bb and Tegrity were both positively correlated with final course grades. However, 'High' and 'Low' Tegrity-access student final course grades were not significantly different. At the end of the semester, students completed 5-point rating scales on 8 course aspects; reading the textbook, attending class lectures, accessing PowerPoint lectures on Bb, online Bb Quizzes, Tegrity-recordings, audio-visual materials in and out of the classroom, and publisher online content. Students rated if each course aspect 'contributed to their learning', 'improved their grades', or 'enhanced their enjoyment of learning'. Students rated online course content positively, and valued lectures, Bb quizzes, and audio-visual materials more than the textbook.","[Cameron, Katherine A.] Coppin State Univ, Baltimore, MD USA",,kcameron@coppin.edu; lsmithwaters@hotmail.com,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",,,978-84-614-2439-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BEZ06,WOS:000318797405100,,No,,,29/11/2017

This has led to a growth in the number of available commercial and emerging open source lecture recording systems. Availability of such systems, along with increased network bandwidth, and student expectations, have acted as catalysts for Universities to progress from initial pilots to wider rollout of such facilities. The systems generally record the audio and video of the presenter, along with screen capture from their presentation, synchronise these elements and automatically create linked chapters to enable students to access the recording online, search for text within the presentation, and recap particular points or make additional notes at their convenience. At The University of Nottingham, in October 2008, as part of a project to identify the potential for the use of these systems across the University, a pilot 'Interactive teaching Room' was installed, incorporating systems for lecture capture and video conferencing. Rather than automatically scheduling recordings in advance, it was clear from early consultations with lecturers that it was of paramount importance that they be able to start the recording themselves, and that they be able to pause the recording during the lecture. By imaginative use of the AMX control interface with which lecturers were already familiar, touch screen buttons were programmed to record, pause and end the recording. To optimise the room environment for video and audio capture, the 'record' button was programmed to automatically trigger additional lighting and start an electronic 'RECORDING' warning sign. Integration with the university existing authentication system meant that access to recordings could be restricted. An associated project to encourage the creation of Open Educational Resources facilitated the wider publication of appropriate recordings on the University's YouTube Edu channel on an opt-in basis. Lecturers retained complete control over how the recordings were made available, and whether they were restricted or open. In the pilot period, lecture content from twenty modules was regularly recorded. The paper examines how engagement with such systems is encouraged by simplifying the process of lecture capture and enabling lecturers to take control of their own content. This is achieved by: empowering the lecturer to take control of recording, while minimizing the complexity of actions required to achieve this, by innovative use of AMX control programming. synchronising the room environment, so that it is optimised for capture, using AMX controls. tailoring the control interface in response to feedback from system users. including timetabling and teaching support staff in developments, to ensure that room/system booking and support procedures are clear and straightforward. Integrating university authentication systems so that restricted recordings are secure. facilitating further publication of material so that open materials are promoted to a wide audience (eg via YouTube Edu).","[Hanford, S.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",,sally.hanford@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",,,978-84-613-5538-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,5279,5289,,,,11,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BEZ08,WOS:000318805505020,,No,,,29/11/2017

To examine the correlation between students accessing recorded lecture files (audio and slides) online and course grades and class attendance. Methods. Second professional year (of 6-year program) students in a therapeutics course had access to recorded online lectures for 72 hours following live lectures. The number and duration of lecture accessions were compared to final course grades and class attendance. Course grades were compared to those of a historical control group. At the end of the semester, students completed a brief survey instrument regarding their use and perceptions of online lectures. Results. No correlation was found between final course grades and the number of lecture accessions (r = 0.0014) or total number of minutes lectures were viewed (r = 0.033), nor between class attendance and minutes viewed (r = 0.2158). Students with access to recorded lectures outperformed the historical control group on the final examination (p < 0.002). Seventy-two percent of students reported no influence of online files on class attendance. Conclusions. Posting lectures online did not affect student outcomes, but students did score higher on the final examination.","[Bollmeier, Suzanne G.; Wenger, Philip J.; Forinash, Alicia B.] St Louis Coll Pharm, St Louis, MO USA","Bollmeier, SG (reprint author), 4588 Parkview Pl, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",sbollmeier@stlcop.edu,,,,,,10,15,15,0,3,AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY,ALEXANDRIA,"1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA",0002-9459,,,AM J PHARM EDUC,Am.

By using networking with IWBs, annotation and gesture can be shared across distances. Emerging possibilities from the integration of NIWBs with video conference, web conference and lecture capture systems are also explored. Three new pedagogies for regional Australian higher education are proposed based on these new capabilities.","[Dawson, Phillip] Deakin Univ, Off Pro Vice Chancellor Rural & Reg, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia; [Dawson, Phillip] Deakin Univ, Sch Educ, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia","Dawson, P (reprint author), Deakin Univ, Off Pro Vice Chancellor Rural & Reg, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia.",phillip.dawson@deakin.edu.au,"Dawson, Phillip/F-6438-2010",,,,,29,5,5,0,6,ASCILITE,COMO WA,"UNIT 5, 202 COODE STREET, COMO WA, 6152, AUSTRALIA",1449-3098,1449-5554,,AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC,Australas.

At Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, tech-savvy undergraduate students can access course content anytime and anywhere by downloading Tegrity class lectures to their personal computers, iPods and smartphones. Students can also link courses to their Facebook pages or write Tegrity sessions to DVDs. Graduate programs in the University's Schools of Graduate and Professional Programs have recently adopted lecture capture solutions to bring teacher training opportunities to distant sites across Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as to some international collaboration sites. The use of Tegrity lecture capture software in the Literacy Education master's degree program at Saint Mary's University has included: (1) assignment of pre-recorded lectures as ""readings"" for class preparation; (2) delivery of classes cancelled because of snowstorms; (3) dissemination of class sessions for students who are absent for illness or family emergency; (4) delivery of courses across national borders; and (5) collaboration with international partners on educational projects such as development of special education. This paper reports the findings of a survey that asked graduate students for feedback regarding their use of Tegrity pre-recorded lectures compared to traditional class preparation and review methods. The survey also surfaced technolgical issues related to access. Suggestions for continuation of successful lecture capture procedures and solutions to technology access problems are discussed.","[Anderson, Jane; Dahlin, Eileen] St Marys Univ Minnesota, Winona, MN USA",,janders1@smumn.edu; emdahl07@smumn.edu,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-613-9386-2,EDULEARN PROC,,,2010,,,,,,,244,249,,,,6,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BEY96,WOS:000318781700039,,No,,,29/11/2017

It was piloted in 2009/10 with a cohort of 400 first year students and it will become compulsory for all first year students in the academic year 2010/11. 'LSE100 The LSE Course: Understanding the causes of things' looks at broad, current questions and issues across the social sciences. Topics include what caused the financial crisis, can we eradicate poverty and how we should manage climate change. Elements of the course have been designed to integrate technology alongside more traditional teaching practices of lectures and classes. It uses Moodle to provide students and teachers with a range of online resources and support. Other technologies used in this course, to supplement the routine automated lecture capture, are PRS, audio feedback and text messaging. This paper presents an evaluation of results from the pilot year and explores students' attitudes towards the use of a range of technologies in teaching and learning. The data was collected through a series of focus groups, one to one interviews and surveys to examine how students view technologies and the impact that they have had on their learning. Research from UCL (Rowlands et al, 2008) suggests that undergraduate students might have different attributes to earlier generations and have different approaches to learning. This paper will explore whether LSE students might be considered a 'Google generation' or display any characteristics that suggest they might be 'digital natives' (Prensky, 2001) in their approach to new technologies. One of the key learning objectives of the course is to equip students with information skills and other transferrable skills which will benefit them both in the rest of their time at LSE and afterwards in their careers. Online resources to support essay writing and to teach students to find, manage and evaluate information have been developed by staff in the Centre for Learning Technology (CLT) and the LSE100 course team. These resources, including an essay writing tutorial which helps student to understand what plagiarism is and how to avoid it, will be demonstrated in this session.","[Secker, Jane; Chatzigavriil, Athina; Leape, Jonathan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Learning Technol, London WC2A 2AE, England",,j.secker@lse.ac.uk; a.chatzigavriil@lse.ac.uk; j.leape@lse.ac.uk,"YALCIN, Haydar/D-1205-2010",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,ACADEMIC CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-906638-82-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,537,546,,,,10,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BVC75,WOS:000291089800067,,No,,,29/11/2017

'Synchrony' in this study refers to the simultaneous playback of audio and video data streams, so that the transitions between presentation slides occur at ""lecturer chosen"" points in the audio commentary. Manufacturers of lecture recording software (e.g. ProfCast) would have us believe that the synchrony of image and audio should improve the learning experience. We have yet to see in the literature any empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. In our study, 90 participants in two groups undertook two electronic lectures (e-lectures) on two separate topics, the subject matter of neither was familiar to them beforehand. Each group experienced one ""synchronous"" presentation (electure) of one of the topics, and one ""separate"" presentation (i.e. PowerPoint and audio files separately presented) of the other topic. Each group therefore experienced both ""synchronous"" and ""separate"" delivery and they were then given an MCQ test that assessed five levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Results show no differences in innate ability between the two groups but the evidence supported our primary hypothesis in that statistically significantly higher test scores were seen when participants viewed a synchronous electure: these scores were accounted for by subjects' performance at three of the five levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Qualitative 'attitude' survey results also displayed participant preference towards the synchronous over the asynchronous mode of delivery, and in spite of general acceptance of the proposed benefits of electronic proceedings, a majority preference towards traditional rather than electronic lectures. Despite this conservatism, this paper explores in more detail the potential benefits of podcasting via synchronous PowerPoint and voice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present an indexing method for computer science courses based on their existing recorded videos. The transcriptions from a speech-recognition engine (SRE) are sufficient to create a chain index for detailed browsing inside a lecture video. The index structure and the evaluation of the supplied keywords are presented. The user interface for dynamic browsing of the e-learning contents concludes this paper.","[Repp, Stephan; Gross, Andreas; Meinel, Christoph] Hasso Plattner Inst Softwaresystemtech GmbH HPI, D-14440 Potsdam, Germany","Repp, S (reprint author), Hasso Plattner Inst Softwaresystemtech GmbH HPI, POB 900460, D-14440 Potsdam, Germany.",repp@hpi.uni-potsdam.de; gross@hpi.uni-potsdam.de; meinel@hpi.uni-potsdam.de,,,,,,53,16,16,1,11,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1939-1382,,,IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

Public concern has heightened the sense of urgency for colleges and universities to make progress on improving and measuring educational outcomes. which is made more challenging by the varieties of diversity facing us. Diversity is not just an issue related to student recruitment or experience, but rather it is one that also relates to institutions and their faculties. New educational methods must address such diversity to be effective, and one possible example can be found in ongoing research at the University of Michigan that explores the educational implications of implementing a,web-based lecture capture system in large lecture courses. Student use of and reactions to such systems is important, as is the potential to influence course performance for students in general. but also for under-represented and at-risk student subpopulations. In addition to helping bring our current landscape into focus. this paper will identify effective practices as well as continuing challenges to improving educational practice for undergraduate students.","[Dey, Eric L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ctr Study Higher & Postsecondary Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,0,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0594-3,AIP CONF PROC,,,2008,1064,,,,,,11,14,,,,4,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BIM33,WOS:000260774800003,,No,,,29/11/2017

In parallel with the whiteboard capture, a digitally-zoomed video of the speaker is created. The significant event images (from cameras and computers) are used to create an index into the video and the images, video and index are complied into a Flash presentation.

Similarly, provision of lecture recording on magnetic tape cassettes dates back at least three decades, and is common place in provision of distance education. However, the digital recording of lectures and making these available to students generally through a learning management system (now referred to as podcasting) is a much more recent phenomenon and has only really impacted on the tertiary education sector for the past 3-4 years (Sull, 2005). This paper addresses the issues of how students utilise these recordings, and perhaps more importantly, how it impacts students academic performance. A major concern in the Australian university sector is that some students choose not to attend lectures. This occurs notwithstanding the belief that lecture attendance is a critical mechanism for the presentation of course material. Researchers have investigated the reasons for this (e. g. Holland and Pithers, 2007) and the most commonly cited reasons for this non-attendance is that students consider themselves to be 'time-poor' and 'too busy with assessments' to regularly attend. Endeavouring to address this problem and ensure student access to course material, university lecturers have availed of recent technological developments and podcast lectures. Being able to download podcast lectures and listen to them at a convenient time and place would seem to be an ideal solution for 'time-poor' students and is often cited as a major reason for university lecturers to consider podcasting their lectures (e. g. Read, 2005). Furthermore, there is evidence that students consider podcasting lectures as being of 'excellent value' to them in their studies (Tynan and Colbran, 2006). While students may consider podcasts to be 'excellent value' from an intrinsic convenience perspective, a more critical concern is how students utilise podcast lectures and how this is associated with student academic performance. Convenience is important for time-poor students, but can podcasts be used as a substitute for lecture attendance, or are they more useful as revision tool. To address this it is first necessary to consider student utilisation of podcast lectures, and then evaluate the relation between student utilisation of podcasts and performance. This is necessary to determine whether podcasts really represent 'excellent value' and if students are getting value from the act of downloading a podcast lecture. The first of the primary results from this study suggest that students do use podcasts, with approximately 85 percent of students accessing the podcasts, and downloading, on average, eight of the twelve podcasts. The second is that the utilization of podcasts is positively associated with student performance, but only when the podcasts are used for revision and only for theoretical questions. The issue of whether podcasts can be regarded as a substitute for lecture attendance for 'time poor' students remains unresolved.","[Bond, David; Holland, Tony; Wells, Peter] Univ Technol Sydney Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,David.Bond@uts.edu.au; Tony.Holland@uts.edu.au; Peter.Wells@uts.edu.au,,"wells, peter/0000-0001-6822-4826; Bond, David/0000-0001-5134-4469",,,,15,1,1,0,1,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-906638-04-7,,,,2008,,,,,,,33,42,,,,10,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,BBP42,WOS:000307812100005,,No,,,29/11/2017

Especially, lecture recording has turned out to be a lightweight method particularly suited for existing lectures and blended learning strategies. In order to not only sequentially playback but offer full fledged navigation, search and inspection of the recorded lecture, chapter marks and search indices have to be embedded. To solve this, two basic approaches for lecture recording tools can be identified - both of them having certain advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand there are systems based on symbolic representation of common slideshow formats like MS PowerPoint. Therefore, they preserve structure and symbol information contained therein, but are lacking flexibility of supported dynamic and interactive formats. On the other hand there are systems based on pixel representation and screen grabbing technologies. While supporting any presentation content, structural and symbolic information cannot be extracted directly and thus has to be post-processed from the recorded video. This paper discusses a perspective of combining these approaches by widening the slide-metaphor to a more flexible scene-based presentation, preserving both the structural and symbolic information. One possible attempt for this is identified by introducing a browser-based scene concept. Symbolic information can be directly extracted from the XHTML source code and structural information derives from switching through scenes. The browser itself is capable of presenting a wide range of dynamic and interactive formats, thus offering more flexible presentations. For approving the proposed concepts, a prototype called ""Virtual Overhead"" was developed and evaluated.","[Stolzenberg, Daniel] Univ Rostock, D-2500 Rostock 1, Germany; [Pforte, Stefan] Baltic Coll, Gustrow, Germany","Stolzenberg, D (reprint author), Univ Rostock, D-2500 Rostock 1, Germany.",daniel.stolzenberg@uni-rostock.de; pforte@baltic-college.de,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-905305-46-9,,,,2007,,,,,,,451,+,,,,3,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Education & Educational Research; Information Science & Library Science; Social Issues",Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Information Science & Library Science; Social Issues,BHJ37,WOS:000253556600051,,No,,,29/11/2017

Also new ways of video network caching are explored.","IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Steinmetz, A (reprint author), IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",arnd.steinmetz@us.ibm.com; kienzle@us.ibm.com,,,,,,19,4,4,0,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3990-8,PROC SPIE,,,2001,4312,,,,,,25,36,,,,12,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Computer Science,BR91C,WOS:000168020400003,,No,,,29/11/2017

As a result, full-scale deployment of digital learning technology has been limited to only a very small number of institutions. The Lectern project aims to eliminate the expensive equipment and operation cost associated with video-based course lecture recording while delivering the same level of instruction effectiveness. Lectern employs the digital pen and touch-sensitive monitor technologies to build a digital desk, which is shown to be able to effectively support conventional lecturing activities and to transparently capture instructors' classroom presentations with minimal intrusion. In addition, the recorded lectures are automatically indexed, converted to a Web-ready format, and made available to end users through the Internet, without any human intervention. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first Lectern prototype, as well as results of a usability test study.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Chiueh, TC (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-6536-4,,,,2000,,,,,,,3,6,,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BQ98D,WOS:000165243200001,,No,,,29/11/2017
