# About this Methodology
Lit reviews should be as repeatable as any other methodology. 


## R Environment
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(tibble)
library(wesanderson)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
```

# Search Protocol
## Web of Science Search
In this example, searching for "lecture recording" OR "lecture capture" in Web of Knowledge (29/11/2017). Save to other formats - tab delimited. 

(Had to save the tab delimited as a csv to read it in properly!)

# Data Management Protocol
## Reading in the Data
```{r}
LRecs <- read.csv("lrec.csv")
LRecs <- 
  LRecs %>%
  rename (Publication.Type = PT, 
          Authors = AU, 
          Book.Authors = BA, 
          Book.Editors = BE,

          Book.Series.Title = SE, 
          Book.Series.Subtitle = BS, 
          Language = LA, 
          Doc.Type = DT, 
          Conference.Title = CT, 
          Conference.Date = CY, 
          Conf.Location = CL, 
          Conf.Sponsors = SP, 
          Conf.Host = HO,

          Cited.Refs.Count = NR, 
          Times.Cited.Core = TC, 
          Times.Cited = Z9, 
          Usage.180Days = U1,

```




## Exploring the Data
### Publications by Time
```{r}
ByYear <- ggplot (data = LRecs, aes(x = Year.Published, fill=..count..)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  labs (title = "Lecture Recoding Publications by Year", x = "Publication Year") + 
  theme_bw() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = wes_palette("Darjeeling"))  + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), panel.grid = element_blank()) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1999,2017,1))
ByYear
```

### Publications by Source
```{r}
BySource <- ggplot (data = LRecs, aes(x = ISO.Source.Abbrev, fill=..count..)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs (title = "Lecture Recoding Publications by Source", x = "Source Name") + 
  theme_bw() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = wes_palette("Darjeeling"))  + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), panel.grid = element_blank())
BySource
```

Need to reorder this somehow


### Wordles
This is not working yet!

```{r}
Abstract.corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(LRecs$Abstract)) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(tolower)  %>%
  tm_map(removeWords, stopwords("english")) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace) %>%
  tm_map(PlainTextDocument)

```

Then...
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Abstract.dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(Abstract.corpus)
```
Getting the following error:
`Error in simple_triplet_matrix(i, j, v, nrow = length(terms), ncol = length(corpus),  : 
  'i, j' invalid`
  
Something about the text having too much N/A stuff? Achhhh I can't do this any longer tonight.
